# 01 July - Saturday - Yerevan - Gyumri- 275 day of immigration

We were in Gyumri today. We bought tickets to local train in advance and used this transport. IT was nice for about 2 hours trip from Yerevan to Gyumri and the same time back. This city is quite old and had name Adrianapol and Leninakan before. This titles are from Russian empire and USSR accordingly. It is quite nice city that is absolutely perfect for one time visit. I don't think that I will go back to the place. We checked several local cafes and restaurants, visited several places of interests and had a good time. I really enjoyed this trip. I made 20000 steps today and my legs are buzzing now. It's crazy. Another nice thing is that I did a lot of duo linguo exercises in train and read several pages of Lord of the rings. I barely have time for reading and sometimes I am really happy to do it. It very relaxes me. I still believe that reading is the best way to train fantasy. You have only words and some mood. All pictures you build in mind by yourself. Yea. This day was nice. I hope that tomorrow will be at least the same. Will see.

# 02 July - Sunday - Yerevan - 276 day of immigration

I started learning fastapi today. It's python's library that help to do simple api's. I really want to learn this language despite the fact that I hated it before. Anyway I need to push my brain to think and analyze a new information. This is important. I also prepared some materials for the future test task that I need to finish withing the next two days. I will wake up much earlier because of it. The next week will be hard because I really need to do much more than usual. First of all I need to finish a lot of DR SMILE's tasks. Second of all I need to be prepared to interviews. And finally I need to increase a holy theory developing pace. Now it's silly. I am not satisfied by it. At the same time we will live in another apartments soon and this is amazing. The rest of the day we were walking and went shopping. I bought shower gel and eyeglass frame online. It will be here soon and I will go to optical shop and do new glasses. My current onces are not so good anymore. 

# 03 July - Monday - Yerevan - 277 day of immigration

So, I was investigating python Fast Api framework, react flow and some other things. I did it because I need to finish some tasks soon. At the same time I had a nice conversation with Fedor head of engineering. I asked some questions and got some answers. I have something to think right now. I am very tiered today and feel lack of energy. I cannot explain what happened but I feel bad. Maybe tomorrow I will be better I don't know. Right now the life is not so nice as before. But before it also wasn't so nice. Sitting in the place that you don't want to sit is sucks. Every time when I think that I am ok I understand that actually not. Shitty shit is still here. I hate it. I want my life to be changed to better direction. Doctoflix didn't answer anything to me. It's absolutely disappointment moment. I expected nice attitude but I see that they are shit.

# 04 July - Tuesday - Yerevan - 278 day of immigration

Today I had two shitty interview that I think it was waste of time. I am in bad mood for the last days. So, I was programming for whole day. I still tried to fin ways how to finish with test task for one company. Tomorrow is the latest day when I can do it. I need to wake up earlier that usual for this purposes. Flow framework looks very interesting. I hope that tomorrow I will finish with it and switch to python back. Now I just want to have a rect and do nothing for a couple hours.

# 05 July - Wednesday - Yerevan - 279 day of immigration

I'm extremely tiered today. I slept horrible. It was headache and I was able to sleep only after taking a pill. For whole day I was fighting to nextjs framework. It was hard and annoying thing. I needed to do it in order to make a coding test for one of the companies. I hope everything will be good. I also had two interviews today. HTe first one is with unpredictable result and the second one was just waste of time. Also I know that our backend developer Anton will leave the company soon. It's bad because he's quite smart and knows everything about the system. It'll be huge lost of the team and for the company in general. He's absolutely demotivated by company's behavior. It's crazy but company does everything to loose him. Now I will go and have dinner. after that I just want ot have a smooth and lazy evening. Will see.

# 06 July - Thursday - Yerevan - 280 day of immigration

I was coding for whole day. It was a hell. I also lost a lot of time this morning in dentist clinic. It was also horrible. I almost finished with some test task that one company asked me to do. I will send it to them tomorrow. I also need to finish some important drsmile tasks. It will be tomorrow. I don't want to thing about it now. Tomorrow I will go to the new apartment. My landlord will give me keys and on Saturday we will move to that place. I'm exacted really. It'll be my first long term home here. This is amazing I'm really tiered. I also finally will get teeth on Monday. It's cool. It was a long journey. Now i will go and have a rest.

# 07 July - Friday - Yerevan - 281 day of immigration

I got keys for my new apartments today. We are going to that place tomorrow. I met landlord and did all paper and other type of work. I send another test task in the morning. I wish to get a feedback soon. The rest of the day I was programming and tried to resolve different problems. last two weeks are crazy. I barely can find time for a lot of things. I still cannot do video about Barcelona. IT's shit. When we got internet at new home I will do it. Another thing is that I like my current apartment much more. There is more space and more rooms and bedroom huge. It's sad. But I cannot afford them.

# 08 July - Saturday - Yerevan - 282 day of immigration

Today we moved to another apartments. This thing happened smooth and we did everything in time. Also we decided trying to be on mobile internet because the home one here is quite expensive. Armenia is't cheap country in this sense. We also visited one local mall and bought some important equipment. It's another part because now I feel some root that grow from me into Armenia. We also discuessed possible next steps for relocation. there is nothing easy. It will be hard. I still don't want to live in Russia. I hate everything that happens there. It's horrible place for living. Authorities don't think about people. The only importance is their reputation and money. I hate everything like this. Because of them my life ruined and confused. I hate it as well. Newermind. I updated holy theory today significantly. I will focus on thing tomorrow. I still work on the project although i don't feel excitement about this every day.

# 09 July - Sunday - Yerevan - 283 day of immigration

So, It was the first calm day for a long time. We went for a walk despite the huge today's heat. It's about 36 degrees outside. It's really really hard. I feel like I'm in Dubai. Yerevan is extremely hot city in Summer. It's so unusual. Maybe in the future I will be adapted but now It's really hard. At the same time I was coding for some time today. It was also hard because I feel so tiered about everything. I try to improve myself and so but it's hard. I'm in completely different reality then I was before. It's also hard to admit. I try to do my best but... you know guy it's hard. At the same time I can plan something now. It's cool. Again. another confusing notes.

# 10 July - Monday - Yerevan - 284 day of immigration

I finally got new teeth today. I have it for the last 2 hours haven't got yet how it is. I feel weird. It feels like some external piece of something in my mouth. I need some adaptation. It's very unusual. So I will go to another doctor soon. Tomorrow I will probably get my new eyeglass frame. I really don't see well in my current glasses. It should help I suppose. Anyway Ksusha found clinic that has dentists and ophthalmologist. I will schedule and appointment there. I also had a hard interview today with some company. It was humiliating waste of time. I didn't feel so bad for a very long time. Hate this shit. Tomorrow will be the another difficult day. I don't want to do anything.

# 11 July - Tuesday - Yerevan - 285 day of immigration

The second day with new teeth or the first full day with them. So it's cool but my gums still hurt. ALso I was coding as usual. I cancelled one interview today because it's lottery. I don't want to work for this type of companies. I also got rejection from company that asked me for coding challenge. Those douchebags event didn't provide a comment what was wrong. I am upset of it. In general I got several rejections and it destroys me. I am even in some depression. I will try to admit it. It's really sad. The cool thing is that I received glasses frame. I will make new glasses soon.

# 12 July - Wednesday - Yerevan - 286 day of immigration

Today I was working for whole day as usual. Fortunately today I had two nice interviews and one feedback from company that rejected me. I also was coding for the hal of the day which helped me to come back to normal condition. This is nice I think. Tomorrow I am going to another dentist for consultation. I need to proceed teeth treatment. I need to remove another three ones and then add veneers. It will be the latest step of my pain. In general today all is good. Tomorrow will be better I hope.

# 13 July - Thursday - Yerevan - 287 day of immigration

I visited another Dentist today. It looks like I will spend much more time treating my teeth. This is really sad. However I can normally eat now. I was coding today heavily. Everything went well I just extremely tiered. I also had a call with one company that is called Okno about relocation. Unfortunately they don't have anything specific for me. I cannot say that they can help me. It's sad. Also I decided to combine all reactjs/nextjs projects into one. I really think about startup visa to some country. Really cool if I can relocate to the US directly. HOwever it's another story. I need to make MVP and then ask for a visa and try to find some accelerator. Currently I don't know what to do exactly. Situation is worse that I expected.

# 14 July - Friday - Yerevan - 288 day of immigration

I didn't do anything significant today. I just finish with some coding and that's it. I also mad of internet connection. It's so bad that I am surprised of it. I also had two interviews today. The first one was with some startup from Germany and one addition with another company. Doctorflix finallly rejected me. It was long waiting. i also started thinking about creation of startup and moving by startup visa. I think it's possible but much harder. I think that it's difficult because I don't have an experience in it at all. Another shot that I am afraid of it. It's huge move. The final thing is that we experienced absence of electricity again.

# 15 July - Saturday - Yerevan - 289 day of immigration

Mission impossible was not so interesting. It was usual movie with Tom Cruse. Today I prepared money and documents for applying for another passport. I am going to rus embassy on monday. Additionally we were on Vardavar lake in Yerevan. I found one account on Instagram that offers SUP board training. I really want to try myself in it again. I think I will text to these people and schedule a visit. Dentist that I found on the internet proposed treatment plan for me. I need to think about it and then continue this. I need to finish some procedures and then I can do venires. So, it was quite productive day I am really tiered and only thing I want to just lie down and have a rest. Tomorrow is Vardavar. It's local holyday when people pour water on each other. it means that I will be at home for whole day. It's fun but not for me.

# 16 July - Saturday - Yerevan - 290 day of immigration

Today is Vardavar, I was sitting at home for whole day. I only went out for a 30 minutes to Wildberries to take a clothes drier. We also watched two episodes of Friends. It was funny and well. At the same time I experienced deep depression today. The situation with relocation is worse day by day. I trapped here in Yerevan due to huge queue in German embassy. The waiting list for a visa is about 10 months. It's hard.
