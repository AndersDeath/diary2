I slept a lot today. It was nice and fair. After that I did some important things, went for a walk for 20 minutes and cleaned mold. Oh fuck the situation with the mold here is horrible. It grows constantly and everywhere. I am tiered of it so much. I event cannot fix it because the building is rotten. The landlord did some cleaning and renovation but in fact the quality of walls, windows, stairs is awful. It's amazingly stupid I would say. I could not expect that such situation is possible in Berlin. It's sad basically. I also updates some important things from my todolist but in general the day was calm and I didn't spend much time of the work. Tomorrow will be different. I will go to the office and try to change my focus to the work. I hope it will be easy because I had enough time for having a rest and starting doing things. Also I decide that I will not drink alcohol this year at all. Additionally I decided to quit from youtube stupid videos. I think that books can replace me some recreation stuff. Instead of youtube videos I will listen to audiobooks. So yes, I will do everything for being better in 2024. I figured out the person that I want to be. So, I need to do some steps for it.

BVG company finally withdraw money from my account for 59 euro ticket. Now I can travel across Germany using all public  transport except high speed trains. It's cool. Also Ksusha got another viewings of apartments. She is cool about it. I am proud of her. Additonally i sent another application for radio tax for her. When I gen both for me and Ksush ID's I can reduce the cost of this tax. It's really good. I spent all day in the office it was quite cold. Another thing that i did a lot of tasks today. I am almost got crazy because of them I am so tiered. At the same time I have to do sport today. It's not fun. However the day was good. I am tiered and a bit annoyed but happy and feel good.

# 03 Januar - Mittwoch - Berlin - 470 Tag der Einwanderung

The first half of the day I spent in the office then I had to go back home because Ksusha was so tiered and didn't want to be alone. It was possible to me and I did it. Also I was working for a whole day on the projects and so. In the evening we had a dinner in one chinese fastfood point where the price is cheap but portions are huge. It's true that if you ever go to some place where a lot of chinese people you can find small restaurants with this cool set up. After that we went to the Berauer strasse and viewed another apartments. I liked the place so it is not so new. At the same time the location is perfect. However we still wait for an answer from another people and have several appointments on this week. I understand that it's hard but we need to find some place. We don't have a choice. It's really important.

# 04 Januar - Donnerstag - Berlin - 471 Tag der Einwanderung

I was working from home today. the weather is much colder than I expected. I was working for a whole day on different tasks and it was nice. Also I viewed an apartment today. The shape of this is quite weird but the location is great. In general I didn't do a lot of things today. I overslept today. However I had an interview today that was nice. I really improved my presentational skills I like it very much. Then I got another invitation for a call with interesting company. I hope to have it next week. The sad news is that one of great owners rejected us. It was a great variant but we were not so good for them. It's sad really. In general it's hard for me that it's so hard to find a place for living in the city. Berlin is harsh. I heard many storied about this. But that was just reflection of somebodies experience. Feeling it by yourself is difficult.

# 05 Januar - Freitag - Berlin - 472 Tag der Einwanderung

The day was busy again. I did a lot of things but I am tiered as well. I updated holy theory and added some words to my next article. The good news that I was selected to two apartments short list. i suppose that soon i will get some answer from both of them and it will be clear if I will have a flat soon. If not I will have to pay for another month living here on Prinzenallee 21. This is nice place but dirty and I don't line attitude of my landlord. It is weird sometimes. So, we also visited sony center. We walked around and it was cool. However the main event is that I entered to two short lists. i really want to fix it as soon as possible.

# 06 Januar - Samstag - Berlin - 473 Tag der Einwanderung

We visited a Frei University library today. It's a great building with cool and modern place. I liked it so much, I am sure that I will come back to that place in the future. We also looked at an apartments that were really nice and I enjoyed the place. I have a hope that we will be selected. The place stays in a cool district and has great transport availability. Additionally I got an invitation to live in one place on Leopoldplatz. It's cool but i am not sure that the place is cool for me. I don't know really. It was the only view that I visited alone. tomorrow we will be on two other places. So, will see. In general the Ksusha's efforts give shoots. She is crazy about this question. Also tomorrow is orthodox christmas, we will not celebrate it but it's a very important tradition.

# 07 Januar - Sontag - Berlin - 474 Tag der Einwanderung

I'm so tiered today. We finally decided to reject contract on leopoldplatz. The place is not so good and I don't like curvy walls in that apartments. We are waiting for two answers from two apartment. I have a hope to be invited to one of them. Will see during the next week. It's really hard. Also we viewed another apartments today. The place is extremely atmospheric but old. I liked the place but Ksusha didn't enjoy it unfortunately. Tomorrow we will have another view of apartments and the day after tomorrow and two days after tomorrow. Yea. We are really focusing on it. Also we wanted to visit one museum but didn't have time and didn't have stamina for it. it's 8pm and I really enjoy to be home. Tomorrow I am going to the office.

# 08 Januar - Montag - Berlin - 475 Tag der Einwanderung

I spent the whole day in the office. In the evening we looked at cool apartments in the nice district. I enjoyed it. I catastrophically don't have time for making things. I cannot find time for all my projects. I have viewings of apartments every fucking day. Event tomorrow I will go to one in the morning, and in the evening we will go check another one together. Also we finally rejected an apartments on Leopoldplatz. The agent didn't send me pictures and he wants us to pay deposing for all 3 months in one payment. It's illegal in Germany. Fuck them. At the same time I have positive thoughts in general. I expect to obtain an apartment at the end of the months. I am so tiered but I feel that my life goes in the proper direction.

# 09 Januar - Dienstag - Berlin - 476 Tag der Einwanderung

In the morning I viewed another apartment. I don't understand what's wrong with Germans. The agent forgot keys and we had to wait for 30 minutes. I didn't have time for it and I just went off. After that I was working for a whole day on different thigns. Tomorrow I need to replace one article in HT project and then the first raw draft will be ready. In the evening we viewed another apartment that are really nice, it's a change that we will be selected. Of course I am not sure. I don't any proves. Anyway I am on it and trying to find a place. Unfortunately it consumes so much time that I cannot do anything for it. I am really waiting for something. I am so tiered of looking for a place. I feel that the end is near me. It's cool.

# 10 Januar - Mittwoch - Berlin - 477 Tag der Einwanderung

I added the final piece of information to my holy theory algorithms thing. This is good. Ksusha went and checked an apartments today. In the evening we went to another place and checked it. After that we got some turkish food. In general I am again don't have time for doing my own things. I hate it and feel bad due to this. I'm trying to do things on time, but in reality the process breaks every time. The immigration process is crazy and it's hard to even find a way to push it. The things just go and I try to adapt my behavior to it. At the same time I had an interview today with one American company for Engineering Manager position. I don't know how it might go because the process in this company is crazy. They want to have 30 minutes interview with HR (it's after the first phone call), then the want to have to 60 minutes engineering interview sessions and after that 4 (SIC!) 60 minutes managerial sessions. I am really jellos. It's crazy that they have so much time for the process. 

# 11 Januar - Donnerstag - Berlin - 478 Tag der Einwanderung

The day was nice I even did something important. Also I received another two invitation for signing in a contract. One of the apartments is really cool for me. We were on viewing several days ago and this place was really cool. I am happy about it. Tomorrow I will look at a contract and if I don't find any weird things it will be signed. I rally have a hope. In this case i will go to the quite place on the edge of ringbahn. It will be good. I was dreaming about another place that i unfortunately didn't get. I was liking one place in Noukeln, but someone else got it probably. In other case we will have to proceed our search. From another side nothing important happened. In the evening we visited Turkish place again. Very soon the place will be not available for us.

# 12 Januar - Freitag - Berlin - 479 Tag der Einwanderung

Today was a team day in XU. I met all people from the different places. In total there were 9 people. The team is very international. I am from Russia, others are from Iraq, Germany, Poland, Morocco, Italy. One guy from Egypt is on vacation. It was very cool and interesting. We had a workshope, after that we were in lunch and played mini-golf. It was cool. Also I signed a rental contract this morning. Tomorrow morning we will go to the flat and talk to ex-tenant. I will ask some question and align several things. In general the day was nice. If everything is ok we will go to permanent flat soon. Tomorrow I will share the result of the conversation.

# 13 Januar - Samstag - Berlin - 480 Tag der Einwanderung

Today we visited our future apartments. It looks very good. Ex-tenant shared a lot of useful information which is very cool. He is a person from Great Britain originally and works as a german teacher. He is also an eco activist. So, yes, he clarified some questions. On monday I will send money to the company and we will receive keys. After that everything will be ours. Also we need to measure the place and order furniture. Tomorrow I will meet Damian Budzinski. We were working together in DR SMILE. When I joined to this company he was QA I worked with. It's cool that we will see each other. It's important to me. I want to check if I was wright about him. In the middle of the day me and Ksusha were on the Bundestag roof. It's also a reichstag that Soviet army sieged at the end of WWII. Additionally we saw a rally with Palestinians fans. It was peculiar. In general today I could concentrate my attention of different from looking for an apartment things.

# 14 Januar - Sonstag - Berlin - 481 Tag der Einwanderung

The day was nice. I did something. Me and Ksusha were sitting at home and tried to prepare everything for the soon moving to the new place. We selected chair, table, laps, bed, and many other things. I wantted to meet Damian but he fucked up the day because he was on party and could be in time. I decided to just ignore this shit and maybe meet him next week. I don't know. In general we were at home for a whole day.

# 15 Januar - Montag - Berlin - 482 Tag der Einwanderung

The day was stupid and fast. I did something in the morning but not so much. After that we went to the new place where got issue with Sparkasse. it was impossible to send money to the rental. Ex-Tennant Mr. Breen went with us to Sparkasse and helped with sending money. It was so embarrassing. It's so sad. Finally we did everything and got keys. It's so weird that landlord gave us 8 keys. It's unusual. Overall we did everything and it's so cool that I cannot say more. Tomorrow will be not so easy day as well. I try to do things well. All thing, including my own things and a lot of different important stuff.

# 16 Januar - Dienstag - Berlin - 483 Tag der Einwanderung

I had a workshop with one of colleges today. We were discussed some important things on backend side and he shared to me important information as well. After that I had an interview for a tech lead position. It was interesting and fast. In the evening me and Ksusha visited our future home. We ordered furniture and tomorrow amazon will probably deliver something. In general we are ok but extremely tiered. It's really hard to do things when you have so many problems. I wish to be calm and cool. However the immigration is really hard.

# 17 Januar - Mittwoch - Berlin - 484 Tag der Einwanderung

I almost adopted to the office work. I was there for a whole day. Ksusha was in the new apartments and received some new things for the home. In general it's really expensive. I don't know how people immigrate and keep their level of life on the same position. It's really strange. It's hard. Also I was coding today and it was nice. It's so cool to stop looking for an apartment. Also I feel better now and finally can work. I am not hundred percent ok, bit very close to it. Tomorrow I am going to the office again and want to test my new bluetooth mic from Boya. Finally I will not have a stupid wire connection. It's really makes recording of the videos harder. Anyway I am going to record short videos and try a new format. I don't have time for editing of videos. I surely need to change the approach.

# 18 Januar - Donnerstag - Berlin - 485 Tag der Einwanderung

The office day was nice again. I did a lot of things. In general I am so under stress that it's hard to just type words for me. In the evening we bought some stuff for home in ikea. Unfortunately it's impossible to buy everything there. I also assembled a chair for Ksusha. I wanted to assemble a table as well but this thing has so many parts. I didn't have time for it. Saturday will be a perfect day. The bed is also was delivered. I will assemble in on Saturday too. Another weird thing is how the delivery works here in Germany. Some goods were expected to be delivered at 9pm today, but it happened at 9am. The think that should be delivered on Saturday arrived today. It's not normal.

# 19 Januar - Fridtag - Berlin - 486 Tag der Einwanderung

I visited a new barber today. The guy is from London. He relocated to Berlin and opened a barbershop. He did everything good but the service is expensive. I paid 75 euros which is 7500 russian rubles. This is crazy. The better haircut in Saint-Petersburg costs in two times less. Also another part of things were delivered to our new apartments. Tomorrow me and Ksusha will go there and assemble everything. The saturday will be very promising. I also hope to have a good time. Forgot to mention I met Ksusha in saloon where she made nails. So this place is organized by Ukranians that ran from their country. Everything screams there about the war. It's not a problem for me and for Ksusha as well. I remember everything. I hate Putin and his fucking morons. They are still traitors of my society.
