# 01 October - Saturday - İstanbul - 2 day of immigration 

The situation hasn't changed. I am still here in İstanbul.
The taxi service there is surprisingly aweful. Uber and others doesn't work properly.
Here taxi drivers select you, not you do it with them. That's very strange. 
It looks like you are in a trap and cannot plan your trip without problems. Sadly it is true. А 
Despite this problem, the day was amaizing. 
We visited several places of Istanbul bienale, nice restaraunt nad metro bridge. after that we went to hamam and massage, that were awesome. we really spent good time, despite the fact that we are extrimely tiered now. From tomorrow I will try to go back to meditation and other practices that help we to survive in this fucking world. maybe I will look at criterias for cto and em.
I need to continue my life and live as it was before the war and fucking putin madness. sure, i cannot understand how to become legal person in this fucking world, but i am sure that i will find a way. the most important thing is to make all documents and find a way how to recieve shengen visa. But, honestly guys, My desiere to bacome an eu citizes is much less. i see that european values are bullshit and shittalk. it's just fucking fiction.
i think a lot about south america, maybe that place is much better that fucking hypocritical europe. now i am going to sit a bit on sofa and read book. i didn't it for very long time bacouse of stress. By the way, Russia retreats in Ukrain. it looks like Putin will be defeated. I hope this fucking facist will recieve all that he deserved. I do not know what the better for him, knot or prison. His crime is so obvious that i think execution shoud be fair and quick.

# 02 October - Sunday - Istanbul - 3 day of immigration

Today is new third day of immigration. i think it is fair to count days from this trip, because things that happened in march were calmer and more understanable. i know that I thought about it in different way, because i was scared. Hovewer now I believe that March was a soft month. It's really wierd to live without understanding what I will hape in the future. it's hard and silly. Ath the same tim I am still in thack with my experiment of daily commints to GitHub. Today is 277th day of pushing. thats really nice. i write code not every day, but i consider all kinds of activities as a programming, even if it is diary notes. The explanaition is very simple, all activities that i do are for my own perfection. anyway, today i need to finish several important things. for example i need to analyze CTO and eM requiretments. it's an important task that will boost my career in the future. I also need to be focused more on this day, and think less about the past. I cannot change anything, yes, i do not want to accept this reality, but I have no choice. only this day and future matter. i really think more about immigration to US. Mahybe not more in general, but i've been thinking about it for the last two or three days constantly. Only future and this day matter. i will tattoo it on my hard. Although you know, from the point of view of philosophy, the present does not exist, since the moment in which we live immediately becomes the past. So, i need to go, maybe I will add some lines here in the evening.

# 03 October - Monday - Istanbul - 4 day of immigration

Today is the first day after starting of mobilization when I work effectively. I did a lot for surevey engine. Tomorro I will implement fully workable prototype of it within Drsmile portal. At the same time i want to share the engine of it with populus. also i still think a lot about what happened. Essentially it looks like i can be outlaw in russia if they summon me to the army. As you know i strongly disagree with it and will not go to country before putin's falling and cancelling of all that stupid new laws. It's realy sad that I do not know if i come back home. I didn't do anything bad, but I am outlaw. It's wierd. The counry might be against me not because I killed someone, but beause I do not want to kill anyone. It's abosolutely new narrative. In simple words this thing is bullshit. again. I need to have a rest a bit and then I will make a desigion, what I can do with it. Again, it's abosolutely unclear. Today Gosduma - russian parlament ratified the decree on the annexation of regions of Ukraine. i think next week Federaton soviet will ratified this as well. Then Putin could start the super war. At the same time, interesting news have been come. Three men has been dead in army. I mean mobilized men, but ordinary soldiers. They probably the first victims of this process.

# 04 October - Tuesday - Istanbul - 5 day of immigration

Today i had a full day of meetings. because of it I didn't have enough time for working on mmy perosnal projects. After that I went to restaraunt with Ksusha which was on roof in the hostorical center of Istanbul. By the way, today is 5th day of immigration. Also I had an interview with Iranian guy who wants to be a part of Drsmile. I didn't like him honestly. Tomorrow I will have more time for coding and dealing with my business. it's nice.
