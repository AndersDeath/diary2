# 31 January - Tuesday - Yerevan - 124 day of immigration

Today I had a interview with Uber. It was just introduction. I wasn't perfect. They want to get staff engineer which is a shitty position. It will be good for escaping from Yerevan, but not so good in general. I lost time and did not pay enough attention to technical training. Also we went to the bank this morning and sent money to London. Ksushas trainer asked her for it. So. I published yesterday a note about holy theory. It's essentially a book that I started composing last year.  The war crossed out my plans about this and I decided to do it in public. It will be a major part of my preparation to future interview as well. I really want to be a manager, but I need to recall my tech knowledge as well. I also extremely tired today.
