# 01 September - Friday - Yerevan - 337 day of immigration

The summer has gone. I did a test task for wunderflats today. I enjoyed this coding and I can expect good result. I don't know what will be with me, but maybe everything will be cool. I would like t work for them, really. This morning my dentist did teeth cleaning for me. it was really successful because they changed color. It's amazing. Tomorrow I will go to another procedure with an another tooth. In general I was working only on test task today. Whatever the outcome, I will reshape this and add to my portfolio. The thing works fine in general and I enjoy it.


# 02 September - Saturday - Yerevan - 338 day of immigration

So, Today I was in dentist's cabinet again. Everything went well and I will probably save this tooth. Me and Ksusha also were walking a bit in the city center. The hardest thing is the weather. Today was about 35 degrees. By the way the autumn is already here. It's absolutely impossible heat for Saint-Petersburg. Despite this fact I miss home. I still do it. It's probably some pain that is impossible to fix. I would be happy to walk on Nevski avenue or on some other streets. I also miss Bugry so much. I miss my relatives. the war cut this option to visit this place. Before the beginning of the tragedy I thought about visiting home several times every ear just buying tickets to airplane. But now there are not air routes from Berlin to Saint-Petersburg anymore. Fucking Putin destroyed this. Additionally I read quite cool book that was written by a nobel prize owner where he provide an information about how our cognitive systems work. In fact if a person has unlimited amount of power they becomes blind even if nobody gives wrong information about the world and about some situations. In simple words when you have power you don't have doubts. And this is some mechanism that we have in our brains. It's hard work to learn how to avoid this deviations. Obviously people in Russian government doesn't know about it. I think they read only Kolobok once.

Today is a final day of mu current vacation. I rested a bit and this is good. I even returned to meditation and yoga. Only one week and I found power for it again. I also reviewed a contract with XU company. I found several questions that will be sent tomorrow's evening. I need to save some time for another interviews. I don't want to sign a contract with XU even if it's a good chance to be relocated. Another two companied have great conditions for relocation. It's important. At the same time I don't want to refuse this offer and stay without them at all. It will be so disgusting and hard. Also we were walking with Ksusha today a bit. She felt bad due to hormonal things and Yerevan's heat. It's 35 today. It's still too much for me. And for all of us. Tomorrow I will proceed working for DR SMILE which I find as boring thing. I'm tiered of them completely despite the fact that some cool projects started within my area of responsibility. Anyway I would be happy to change place and finally work in some other environment. Currently it's something about future. Fortunately it's about nearest future.

# 04 September - Monday - Yerevan - 340 day of immigration

The first working day was nice and hard. Unfortunately I didn't get an answer from the wunderflats. Maybe tomorrow they will text something to me. I found that I had a plan to write an article about how to get data from github. So, I refactored code a bit and when I have free time the writing process will be started. I have some plan to become an author on hackernoon. Anyway I also found a way how to demonstrate some important info on my portfolio website. In general day was hard but a bit boring. All these steps are quite tiresome.

# 05 September - Tuesday - Yerevan - 341 day of immigration

This working day finally finished. I fucked up today's interview. I could not do a task and I also spoke a lot of shit. so, I am upset. Anyway I did something good today despite the fact that I wasn't in good mood. Yesterday I felt nice, but today I am bad. It's bullshit. Because of that interview I don't want to do anything. I did everything wrong. Anyway it's good lesson for me. I am really want to finish all this hiring process as soon as possible. I am tiered of it. It's almost a 8 months since I started interviews. Hate it. At the same time, starting working for XU means that I will ned to looking for another position in 4 months after starting working for them. It will be in march. Fuck that shit. I want to just live without pressure, and this is impossible. I am not depressed. I am just tired and upset.

# 06 September - Wednesday - Yerevan - 342 day of immigration

The day was nice and hard. I even did something for drsmile. Usually it's hard. I was in Podologist cabinet she performed procedures on my legs. I hope that I will be ok soon and will not think about current problem. I hate it and I am tiered of it. also I had two interviews today. the first one was with startup and another one with General electric healthcare division. It was interesting but long. I did my best. I also got a rejection for yesterday's interview. I would be really surprised if I passed it. Everything finished like I expected - rejection. 

# 07 September - Thursday - Yerevan - 343 day of immigration

So, I got an invitation to Wunderflats. I will have a technical call tomorrow. I hope everything will be good. Also DRS MILE again didn't send money to me. It's awful bullshit that destroys me. I am happy that this will be finished soon. I don't want to be there anymore. The product  turned to moe interesting direction, but management level sucks. Besides that I improved portfolio website significantly. Tomorrow I will proceed working on it because I cannot do anything that are related to DR SMILE. I pissed of the money situation. I also improved holy theory project a bit and created two other scripts that generate html and markdown websites.

# 08 September - Friday - Yerevan - 344 day of immigration

So, I had an interview with Wunderflats today. It was absolutely controversial. I don't expect a good result. i hope they will give me an answer on monday. I also finally got money from fucking financial department. I also updated portfolio website. I still working on articles that I will finish soon. THis is extremely important. I have much more time because the number of interviews decreased significantly. However I pissed of DR SMILE again. This situation with money, absence of answer about three years working vacation. I even think bad about my shared plan that they have to me to me after december in January. Bullshit all this stuff. I just don't believe to them and I will be extremely surprised if they send that paycheck to me.

# 09 September - Saturday - Yerevan - 345 day of immigration

Today was a nice holiday. I visited my dentist. She healed my another tooth. It's cool. Me and Ksusha also were walking in the city center as usual. After that I called to Oleg finally. He was in Serbia then in Kazakhstan and now he's in Philippines. He tried to immigrate to Portugal but it was unsuccessful. It's sad. Now he is looking for other opportunities and just has a rest. Manila is dangerous and he lives in the next to capital other city.
