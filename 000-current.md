# 01 March - Wednesday - Yerevan - 153 day of immigration

Today I was working for whole day on DR SMILE projects. My local Angular setup has been broken and nothing works. It's absolutely sad thing. It means that tomorrows morning I will be working on resolving of this thing. I was talking to Narayan for whole day. This man is from India and he works for Dr SMILE as front-end engineer. I didn't have tim eto make a lot of commits unfortunately. I added two trainings to Holy Theory. I like this project. tomorrow I will work a lot on docker containerization. Also I am going to work on another things related to system design questions. I've got an access to Notion AI today. This tool is amazing but it has a tiny limit of requests.
