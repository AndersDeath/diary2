# 01 December - Thursday - Gündoğan - 63 day of immigration

Today is 2 months since i left Russia. I still feel bad. I really dream about a moment when I can be in good mood and calm. I feel that I am extrimely tiered of the situation. I know that much more people in worse situation that me, but I feel it as it is. I am also extrimely tiered of the working for DR SMile. It seems that I am very close to be burned out. 

Despite the my mood I try to do things in time. I go through my todolist, don't forget about lessons, and try to study something everyday. I try to find stability in my mind, but honestly I feel everything so useless. I don't want live in this shit.

Sometimes I even think about going back to Russia and trying to find job there. Only fear of death holds me from it. I think I need to come up with some strategy for future asap. In other case I will go crazy. 

Only one thing exists - everything will be ok. I believe in it.

# 02 December - Friday - Gündoğan - Turgutreis - 64 day of immigration

It's really cool that we got new jaket for Ksusha today. The thing we had going to Turgutreis for it. But this is no a problem. The problem is absence of jaket. The Turgutreis bus was filled by young studenst of local Gundogan school. Surprisingy the behaived well. Alsot because of the 20 000 000 revenew of DR SMILE I have a half day off. It's really funny, but I am grad to have it anyway. From studying perspective I got rhetorics of story lessons. it's was interesting and quite well. Unfortunately it wa the only thing that I've done today. Finally I posted a new video. It's good becasue I didn't have time for editing it. I like to record all that stuff, it is like therapy for my. Also I had to finish my math lessons and probably I will finish with Portugal ones as well. The probem is that i don't have time for it. Maybe in the future I will come back to them. But now It's imposible. I think I can focus on Ukranian. It's quite easier that absolutly new language that didn't learn before. Also it's more convinient to learn something from the same family. Tomorrow we are going to Bodrum for the last time. we will go to istanbul and then to Yerevan on the next week

# 03 December - Saturday - Gündoğan - Bodrum - 65 day of immigration

The very last weekend in Bodrum has been started. We are going back to Istanbul in the next wednesday. We said good buy to Bodrum today and to Turgutreis yesterday. Tomorrow I will try to record the last video here in Gundogan. Newermind. Today we discussed my new CV. There is something for working. I will change several lines there on the next week. In general today I had a free day. I did something, but mostly not so important. I decided to groom my guthup repositories, but I have a lot of them. I started putting all this stuff to a notion table, but i was tiered of this and decided to make a script. so, now I have 117 repositories, it's too much. tomorrow I will try to proceed working on it. yeap. Returning to the original topic, I'm glad I'm leaving. It's quite a village. I'm tired of this place

# 04 December - Sunday - Gündoğan - 66 day of immigration

The very last weekend in Gundogan has been finished. The day after tomorrow we will flight to Istanbul, where we will be for two days and then go back to Yerevan. Honestly, I am glad about it. Also I will take day off on wednesday in order to walk in istanbul. Also I tried to record a video today. I've made a lot of variats. It was really hard to do, but I decided that I have to do it. finally I went to the roof and recorded video there. I don't know if that shots are good, but I have only them. Also I tried final cut pro, and honestly it much better that imovie. It's a piece of shit. I finally finished with new opening for videos, it's some kind of cover to immigrant song. I repeated drum pattern there. Then I found that if you record video on iphone using macbook as a station if the last one goes to sleep mode video recoding just freezing. It's absolutely bullshit I think. But maybe it's again for privacy mode. The another important thing is that I finished with a script that fetches all data about reposfrom github and push them into notion table. It's amazing beacuse the script is exttrimely simple and everyone can repeat it. I dring an alcohol the third day in the row. I strarted doing it on friday. I started bottle of beer, yesterday I got a glass of wine, today I got a bottle of beer again. I don't like this. i am extrimely nervouse. It's sad.

# 05 December - Monday - Gündoğan - 67 day of immigration

Today I wasn't be able to do a lot of things. the whole day was dedicated to call and meetings. It wasn't so good, but I had no choice. Today's noght is last here. tommorow we are going to flight to Istanbul. I learned some management, english and Ukranian today. Please don't ask me why I learned the last one. It's just beacuse I had a good mood. Also I brought a Ksushas jaket to a tailor. He fixed is and now it's well. I don't remember if I mentioned it before, but Ksusha and me bought a jacket for her on the local on-line market and it had a manufacturing defect. So, we decided to charge back and push this shit back to the shop, but just fixed it my ourselves. Today I also need to pack all my luggege and prepared everything for tomorrow's trip. I am happy that I will go to another place, but again, it will a stress. I would be happy to find my own place. Otherwise I will go crazy. Surely I have gypsy blood, but it's not cool to live this way. I really want to have home.

# 06 December - Tuesday - Gündoğan - Istanbul - 68 day of immigration

So, We checked out from the house. Now I am sitting in Bodrum's airport and waiting for boarding. Baaiacally I studied some cool things today and the rest of the time was dedicated to packing things in luggage. honestly I am glad to leave this place but ath the same time I fell lazyness. I just don't wanto to do anything. today I whatched important videos about how to understand storytelling muli act system. It was very interesting and I event dounloaded script of Alien movie for analysis. I don't want to be professional in these area but It woould be cool to adapt some interesting things for my future video. currently they don't have neither structure nor sense. I really want to fix it. 

# 07 December - Wednesday - Istanbul - 69 day of immigration

Tpday we visited museum of Gaza here. It's quite interesting place and ex-coal electic station. Almost all exibitions were close exept the main one that is about climate changes. At the same time library and cafe were opened. After that we went to shopping mall. We bought some good for Ksushas sister. Ther we used metro and went to Istiklal. We bought goods there as well, visited Starbaks and had a good time. I took photos from ex-terroristik act place. It's interesting that there is no evidences of tragedy. I think it's good tactics. They wanted to scare people. but they just dont's react. The we came back to the house. I can say that the apartment is not so good as it is on pictures. Luckily we will go away tomorrow. Honestly I am very glad to be here again. It's a nice place and city. it's much more better than Bodrum area. However I feel tiered. Yesterday's flight was quite quick and ewasy. Only hard thing is to carry all our luggege. It's really heavy. My steps are in pain. Tomorrow we are going to work for whole day and only after that move to airport and Yerevan. I've made a full day off fot myself today. I did nothing exeprt walking and shopping. It was amaizing. Winter's Istanbul looks like Rome in some point. I really like it. Sometimes I feel how I want to live here and don't move to another place, but I know that is quite impossible becaouse It's hard to live legally here. By the way the weather is fine here. It's not so cold and I event don't need to wear winter shoose.s
