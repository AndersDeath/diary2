I had a call with NN they decided not to proceed with me. The first call was moved to another day because of hr specialist's sick leave. I hope we will have a conversation the day after tomorrow. Additionally I had a call with Yassir guy. I don't thing that this company is a good fit for me. At the same time it's april but I don't have offers at all. This time a job search goes much more difficult. Maybe I really was wrong and I should go to Germany to some company. it's difficult.

# 05 April - Wednesday - Yerevan - 188 day of immigration

Nothing significant happened today. I feel that I'm tiered of situation again. I would like to immigrate to another place but I cannot do it. every fucking day I work hard on it. It looks like I do something wrong. I maybe need to focus more on performance and publicity. It's so hard to understand. Each case including mine is unique. You really don't know where is that shot that can move you to another position. Sometimes I really start to think about starting own business. It's really hard to understand. It's april outside but I still don't have an offer on a table. It's disgusting. I don't blame anyone at the same time I cannot understand how to crack the system. I hope I will find the way. I don't want coming back to Russia again. I really don't

Today we did nothing. we went for a walk and made around 18000 steps. Also we finally visited Hard Rock cafe. It's such a nice place. there are a lot of interesting artifacts like korn's guitar, guitar of zakk wilde, cher's boots, etc. It's the place where nice music plays. I really like it. We also visited interesting pizzeria that is near Republic Square metro station. If I'm not mistaken it's called Mozzarella. we went to Razdan river and children' railway. I also drunk a bit beer. I usually don't drink it but sometimes it's nice. I like beer in general and had huge problems with it in the past. Luckily I don't have them anymore. It's was a nice free day and I like it. I also did one task on leetcode. I still try to continue solving problems every fucking day. I hope it'll help me. I still don't know. Today life is quite easier.
