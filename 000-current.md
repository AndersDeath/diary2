# 01 Februar - Donnerstag - Berlin - 499 Tag der Einwanderung

Уникальный момент. Я обычно не пишу дневник на русском, но сегодня решил воспользоваться великим и могучим. Вообще у меня есть мысль снова перейти на русский язык в ведении дневка. По большей части я хочу это сделать для того чтобы иметь возмодность лучше раскрыть свои мысли. Ну и объем увеличится кратно. Итак, сегодня я был в офисе. Я провер ретроспективу для своих коллег и кажется им понравилось. Также я ходил со своим начальником прогуляться по району и болтал о разном. В первый раз такое было. Помимо этого есть высокая вероятность что я поеду в Манхайм на следующей неделе. Дело в том, что меня пригласили на онсайт интервью. Я думаю что это хорошая возможность размяться и вообще посмотреть что там происходит в проекте. Это небольшой стартап, который планирует начать производство и мне это интересно. Вообще, тут огромное количество стартапов и я хочу участвовать в них, это может мне позволить неплохо развиться в финансовом и не только план. Логичто что я хочу развиваться и зарабатывать. Для этого я приехал сюда. Вообще настроение неплохое, рабочие забрали поломанную стиральную машину и мы скоро закажем новую. Спалось на новой квартире хорошо. До сих пор не вериться что это мой новый дом. Есть что-то странное в том что я живу теперь в Берлине.

I can say that I'm bored by this diary. I do this more than a year. In april it will be two years that I write down my thouhts here.

Anyways. let's go back to things that happened today. so I was working as usual and everything was nice. The main goal for today was to change registration here. we wnt to Pankow burgeramt and was surpeised by absend of signature in the confirmation that we live in this apartments. It's so crazy that I cannot balieve in it. It's so shitty shit. Unfortunately we found it in the clerk's cabinet. It's so shitty. Luckily Ksusha obtained a termin for the next teusday. I am happy about it. I will call to the landlord and ask to sign the document. This is very important because we have eveything for getting residency. it's also extremely important. After getting documents we can tavel out and inside the Europe with no problem.

# 09 Februar - Freitag - Berlin - 507 Tag der Einwanderung

To be honest processes in XU are set up awefully. I had to rewrite a lot of things that I did for the last several weeks. It's strange. I would be hapy to change my job. I need to really work here but I don't want to do it. I really want to work as CTO. Anyways I am going to this direction. The another significant thing happened - workers from Telecom came to us and set up something. It means that on the end of the next week we will have an internet connection. It's very cool. Besides that I called to landlord and they prepared proper paper for Burgeramt. It's so cool that on the next week we will make almedung. It's really nice and cool. Additionally I feel so strange because I satred gaining weight. It happens because of stress I eat much more that usual. I need to control it again. I thing that I will buy something for running. I really like to do it and I need to do it. Since we are here for a long period of time I can afford equipment for it.

Tomorrow we are going to another termin in order to get an almedung. It's really cool and I am happy about this. it will be the last preparations for sending an application for my blau card.

# 13 Februar - Dienstag - Berlin - 511 Tag der Einwanderung

Anmeldung is in my pocket. We got it pretty easy for 5 minutes with 2 hours in U-Bahn to both directions. Then we came back and I asked a password in cafe that is under us. Vodafone should sent a equipment to me but it will happen in the end of the week. It's really good. Also Ksusha filled all forms and preapare all documents for Blau card and sent them. I hope to have residence permin in two months. Now I just need to wait. Also the problem is that we will need to visit the govermental office but it's impossible to get a termin. They will send time and date. Nobody knows when. It's usual. In general the day was nice but long. I need to do sport and then I can just lay down and have a rest. It will be sooooooooo cool.

# 14 Februar - Mittwoch - Berlin - 512 Tag der Einwanderung

The valentine day went well. The Spanish/Portugeese restaraunt that I found on TripAdviser was really nice. I enjoyed food very much. Besides that I had a talk with my manager - Paul. They wasn't happy about my approach to work. I decided to correct my behaviore despite my disagreement with their approach. Ok, I need this job and I will admit their rules. It's very important for now. Surely I need to find another cool place for work, but now I need money for paying bills and just living. Addtionally I need to pay more attention to my mental health. Meditation helps but not so much unfortunately. I need to come up something new.

# 15 Februar - Donnerstag - Berlin - 513 Tag der Einwanderung

I spent the whole day in the office and did some tasks. I also talked to people and it was nice. After that I came back home and just had a rest. As you know I decided to reshape my schedule and dedicate more time to my condition and mental situation. I really try to do this in a good way. Tomorrow I will be home for a whole day and I also should recieve an email from telekom with instructions. It's cool by the way. Besides that I need to do some sport and in general have good time (I hope). On the next week I have a talk with Paul about my probation period status. We need to set goals and some objectives about what they want to see from me. I see that interviews have been going slowly. It means that I really have a chance to stuck with XU for a time. Because of that I need to change my behaviour strategy. I will dedicat much more time to programming and work in general. I want to be in a balance. I still want to get some managerial role but at the same time I need some money for living. Also I still don't have an answer from DR SMILE side. It means that I need to push them somehow. For example I can visit their office and ask questions in person.

# 16 Februar - Freitag - Berlin - 514 Tag der Einwanderung

Navalny was killed. It's very unusual. Russian government decided to kill him. Putin did another fucking step. So, now it's apsolutely clear that they are enemies and animals. It's so strange. I visited a rally in Berlin's city center that was in front of russian embassy. I met Ksusha there and also Ivan and Elena. It was cool. We walked a bit. Besides that the day was nice. Ksusha finished their deisgn project that is really cool. She has a portfolio and start lookin for a job. It is cool. I am happy for her. Yes, this Friday is very controversial. I cannot understand what will happen. Now it's just hard.

# 17 Februar - Samstag - Berlin - 515 Tag der Einwanderung

Today was the standard Saturday. We were walking a lot and had fun toda. Firstly we went to Bauhaus archive just for looking at construction. Secondly we visited Jewish museum. It's not only cool place for researching of their culture but also cool postcionstructivism building. I liked this day. I still have a lot of thoughts about Navalny and his murdering. Another page was turned. Something new is about to start. It's bad and shitty. However I am here in Germany and I left country for having normal future. I will do everything for rebuilding my life. Well, I already started. I also finished working onf main draft of handsbook. I should polish it and publish.

# 18 Februar - Sonntag - Berlin - 516 Tag der Einwanderung

I had a rest. I feel better and better. It's really cool because I want to do something new again. It's really unusual feeling for the last month. In general I've been working hard on reducing of stress pressure. I will now on the next week if everything is good with my probation period. I don't know. The first project I participated it wasn't so good to be honest. I hope that I will not have bad consiquences. I don't know. I am a bit scared because I feel so big pressure. In bad case I will need to find job quite soon. But I will see. Currently it's not so clear. Will see. The future is not determined. I think when someone read my diary the perosm will be surpriced by the fact how I am anxious person. I am just tiered.

# 19 Februar - Montag - Berlin - 517 Tag der Einwanderung

This day was nice. I enjoyed sitting here and working on different things. Ksusha doesn't feel well today unfortunately. It's sad. She is in the bad now. also telekom workers came to us again today. It was strange because they should not be here today. It's very unusual. I am also very suspisios and I am a bit scared about it. The good thing is that I will meet the potential parter tomorrow. I will meet him after office that I also need to visit. After business things me and KSusha will go to the cinema. It will be the first movie in english in my life seeing in movie theater. In general the day was good.

# 20 Februar - Dienstag - Berlin - 518 Tag der Einwanderung

The day was nice. I had a cool conversatino in the office and me and my manager defines some objectives that I need to achive. I am glad to have them because it decrease the pressure that I expirienced. This is nice. Also I met a startup guy that want to build a company and raise money. I am happy about him but I have no idea if he has money. For me it's important to have salary. Without it I will feel really bad. After this meeting I met Ksusha and we watched a movie on Berlinale. It was really cool. We watched Architekton. It's really beautiful and smart movie. If you have time please find it and spent time with pleasure. The next movide we are going to watch Gojira movie. Yes, that classical black and white one. I didn't see it before. It will be the first time for me.

# 21 Februar - Mittwoch - Berlin - 519 Tag der Einwanderung

I overslept today. The night was hard for some reasons. It's sad. But in general the day was nice. I had a call with some comapny. It was absolutely dry and usual. I didn't get something new. Tomorrow I am going to be more concentraited because I need to fix much more things. At the same time I feel good. My mental condition became better. Me and Ksusha went for a dinner to vietnamise restaraunt and had a good time. Overall nothing happened new today. Also the problem is that I write some thoughts here only in the evening when I don't remember what happened. I need to reload this diary format. It should be updated somehow. I will think about it. I even added it to my todolist for tomorrow. Now I just don't have power. will go and have a rest.

# 22 Februar - Donnerstag - Berlin - 520 Tag der Einwanderung

Another working day has been finished and I am happy about it. I did sport and this is really cool. I am in the track and don't miss sport. I am going to increase time and number of exercises. Now I do sport for 25-30 minutes but I need to increase to an hour. I am doing pretty well here. Another thing that I visited sparkasse and changed my address there which is very nice and important. In general I almost replaced Prinzenalle to Erich Nehelman everywhere. Besides that nothing intereseting happened today. So, because of this I want to change my approach to this diary. I will do it tomorrow.

# 23 Februar - Freitag - Berlin - 521 Tag der Einwanderung - Sunny

I found that XU developers are in very bad mood. They don't understand a behaviour of management. It's really interesting part and I see this kinda situation for the first time in my life. It is interesting. THe most cool thing is what the menegmant will do with it. I have no idea and to be honest it's absolutely not my business. I am a senior software developer there. Moreover, I am already in searching for a job process. I don't want to spent life there. I also stared another refactoring on builder for my handsbook. The current version is not so understandable. Also only now I understood what I really want to have on the builder side. In short it should be almost the same code but with some scalibility. Currently it has a lot of mistakes and unclear things inside. It's a spagetty shit. It will fix it thigs weekend. The time has come, my friends. As you see I have better mood today.

# 24 Februar - Samstag - Berlin - 522 Tag der Einwanderung - Sunny

Two ears since the war started. It's sad date that I will not forget in my life. SOmetimes I still think that Russia is cursed. At the same time I believe that it's another part of disassembling of Russian empire. It's sad and unfair for all of us. Especially we are not lucky that this kide of people sit in Kremlin and do all these horrible things. However I still believe that something good happen. We need just to wait a bit. I am not sure that this nice things will happen before I die but who knows. Right now I am sure that I will not come back to Russia anymore. Now I live here in Germany. I just started my adaptetion and I will have the first german class next week. I really want to get normal documents. After that I will be able to move to the US. Maybe I will even do it earlier. Also we were in cinema museum of Berlin today. Germany really can build great cultural places. I enjoyed it very much. After that we walked to Brandenburg gates and saw Ukranian rally. They screamed some slogans against Russia. I took a couple of photos and we proceeded our way home. Also I believe that I need to reshape my day. I already started doing this. I changes the framework for this diary and decided to share more real thoughts. Currently all my descriptions are just about how my days go and nothing more.

# 25 Februar - Sonntag - Berlin - 523 Tag der Einwanderung - Sunny

Unfortunately the sunday has finished. It's really sad. We were on Godzilla movide today. A director from Japan did some reissue of the original 1954 movie. I watched this for the first time and was quite surprised how ti was good. I enjoyed this movide a lot. It is a shame that I didn't do it before. Besides that I did a lot of important things today. I cleaned the apartmets, analysed some important information and spent an hour of holy theory. It was really cool. The only stuff that missed for today is sport. I need to do some exercises before going to my bed. I will start doing it just afte finishing writing these lines down. I also supposed to visit the office tomorrow but BVG decided to do another strike and it will be just impossible to reach out the place in the morning. It's another episode of local madness. Oh, I completely forgot to mention that I recorded another source for the new diary video. It's really cool. I will start editing soon. Another part is to decided how I can start recording videos in english. It's still very hard and unclear thing for me.

# 26 Februar - Montag - Berlin - 524 Tag der Einwanderung - Cloudy

The day was chilly. I basically finally did everything I had in my list and this is crazy and cool. to be honest. I did some holy theory stuff, I did some XU stuff, I read some important articles and event helped Ksusha in reshaping of my resume. Another impressive and extremely cool thing it that Ksusha finally had a firt job interview. She was talking to a man who has a studio in Russia but he want to expand his business finally to EU and US because he left the country because of the war. In general the day was nice. Tomorrow will be maybe even better. Besides that I don't know what to add because the day was just caml exept the great Ksusha's inteview. Addtionally I proceeded learning stuff on Y combinator website. I really want to finish it and just and to absorb.

# 27 Februar - Dienstag - Berlin - 525 Tag der Einwanderung - Cloudy-Cold

I was in the office today. I had a nice talk with my colleges. We discussed racism in eroupe and it was really interesting. Especially the situation in Italy where nothern part destroyed southern one. Not literally but culturally. Also I had to reject the startup person because I just don't jave resources for handling a company on so early stage. I don't have money for living. Ksusha updated my resume and now I have super short and cool document that I will share to other companies in the future. Maybe this format will be better. Besides that I finally paid the last part of deposit. It's great. I will have more money on the next months that I can spend on my own deals. It's good. Besies that nothing significant happened today.

# 28 Februar - Mittwoch - Berlin - 526 Tag der Einwanderung - Cloudy-Cold

Today I had the first German lesson.
