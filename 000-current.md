# 01 April - Saturday - Yerevan - 184 day of immigration

This day was nice. I visited a barbershop and got haircut. I did a lot of think for Kentron lib. As I expected I finished with implementation today. I need to finish tests only. I was walking a bit today. Unfortunately the weather is a piece of shit. It's quite cold today. The rest of the day I was chilling and did noting. I like it. Tomorrow I will work for whole day but on my own things that is cool.
