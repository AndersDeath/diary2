After that she had to move from bus station to airport through the whole Moscow. I hope landing will be also well.

# 04 April - Tuesday - Yerevan - 187 day of immigration

I slept bad today. I went to the bad quite late because I went to airport in order to meet Ksusha. At the same time I feel how my mood become better. I againt want to write code for DR SMILE. I had a call with NN they decided not to proceed with me. The first call was moved to another day because of hr specialist's sick leave. I hope we will have a conversation the day after tomorrow. Additionally I had a call with Yassir guy. I don't thing that this company is a good fit for me. At the same time it's april but I don't have offers at all. This time a job search goes much more difficult. Maybe I really was wrong and I should go to Germany to some company. it's difficult. At the same time I still extremely tiered of DR SMILE despite the fact of coding desire.

# 05 April - Wednesday - Yerevan - 188 day of immigration

Nothing significant happened today. I feel that I'm tiered of situation again. I would like to immigrate to another place but I cannot do it. every fucking day I work hard on it. It looks like I do something wrong. I maybe need to focus more on performance and publicity. It's so hard to understand. Each case including mine is unique. You really don't know where is that shot that can move you to another position. Sometimes I really start to think about starting own business. It's really hard to understand. It's april outside but I still don't have an offer on a table. It's disgusting. I don't blame anyone at the same time I cannot understand how to crack the system. I hope I will find the way. I don't want coming back to Russia again. I really don't

# 06 April - Thursday - Yerevan - 189 day immigration

Tomorrow i will also have a call despite the fact that it's a holiday in Berlin.

# 07 April - Friday - Yerevan - 190 day of immigration

I was programming for whole day. I didn't do anything significate. I had an interview with cheeky HR. She just sent me an invitation yesterday without any connections. It was extremely rude I suppose. They are going to pay few money but have a huge expectations.

# 08 April - Saturday - Yerevan - 191 day of immigration

Today we did nothing. we went for a walk and made around 18000 steps. Also we finally visited Hard Rock cafe. It's such a nice place. there are a lot of interesting artifacts like korn's guitar, guitar of zakk wilde, cher's boots, etc. It's the place where nice music plays. I really like it. We also visited interesting pizzeria that is near Republic Square metro station. If I'm not mistaken it's called Mozzarella. we went to Razdan river and children' railway. I also drunk a bit beer. I usually don't drink it but sometimes it's nice. I like beer in general and had huge problems with it in the past. Luckily I don't have them anymore. It's was a nice free day and I like it. I also did one task on leetcode. I still try to continue solving problems every fucking day. I hope it'll help me. I still don't know. Today life is quite easier.

# 09 April - Sunday - Yerevan - 192 day of immigration

Today we were walking again. We went to SAS food court that is near out previous apartments. Then we walked among tumo center and to huge SKK staduim. After that we visited the armenian henocide monument and went down from hill to dolma garden mall. In general this walk was quite nice. I also created a plan for future vide that I am going to record the next morning. Tomorrow is a holiday in germany and I will not have meetings. I also will have a chance to finish with my routine tasks. from tomorrow I will go back to usual pace. I need to finish a lot of things before vacation. From business things I did some coding thins morning and such things. Now I need only to finish something for holy theory.

# 10 April - Monday - Yerevan - 193 day of immigration

It was a typical monday. The hard endless day. I recorded new sources for the next video. I will start editing tomorrow. I was coding a bit and I went back to business questions and trainings. I feel how it became boring. I mean programming questions. Sometimes I need relax. However I published another version of holy theory. I every day try to add improvements to it. The weather in Yerevan isn't so good today. It's raining outside and the atmosphere is quite depressive. I really want to sleep for whole day. So, I will go and do some sport right now. It's a time.

# 11 April - Tuesday - Yerevan - 194 day of immigration

I feel quite depressive today. It's not a first time, but I totally hate this kind of things. Russian government created new law that gives them an option of sending online letters with order to arrive to military service. even if you miss it for some reasons, you must go. Repressions are still here. It makes me feel uncomfortable. It's really bad. I also was coding for whole day. Maybe I will try to get the second job. I want to have more money and opportunities. I/m investigating this things. The job searching process is extremely slow this time. One year ago I already had two offers for three months. It's hard. I hope that I will find another place. I still don't know if it's possible. Apparently every time when I get thins kind of news I feel bad. Much worse than usual. anxiety feeling is constantly with me. I really want to just live.

# 12 April - Wednesday - Yerevan - 195 day of immigration

Today I was coding for whole day and it was quite cool. I also did some coding trainings. unfortunately I had to work on DR SMILE's tasks. I did one minor improvement for eleventy though. I also was reading a lot about new law that turns all men in Russia to slaves. Military slaves I would say. This is ridiculous. Sometimes I really cannot understand them. They are crazy bastards. I think that Russia and our society are very close to revolution. This kind of shit is impossible to handle. I hope that situation will be changed soon. It's april outside and it's means that 6 months of good weather are in front of us. It's good time for protests. I don't understand who will lead this protest but I think that something is cooking by someone. I think that it will be reach people that can sponsor the protests. It will be very soon. I hope that this shit will be resolved in this year. In other case this shitty putin will be in power until his death. Unfortunately he is quite healthy person.

# 13 April - Thursday  - Yerevan - 196 day of immigration 

Babbel company rejected me. I had an interview with Paris's company "Shift" and they already scheduled another one with me. It's cool. I think that France is quite interesting country. Let's see how it will work. I don't expect anything from others anyway. I feel much better today. I have no idea why. I hope it's not a bi-polar psycho shit. I was programming for whole day and had a nice conversation with Artem about his past and why he moved to another life and city. I also already started video editing. I'm going to publish this stuff on this weekend.

# 15 April - Saturday - Yerevan - 198 day of immigration

The one the hardest things for me is to dive intro writhing process. I spend a lot of time on training of writing skills. I really don't have time to write, despite the fact that I really like to do it. So I need to work on it. We were in Hard Rock cafe again. It was tasty and nice. We also were in another cafe where we were working for a while. I prepared all documents for future trip. I just printed all of them. There are tickets, bookings in my folder now. In the cinema we watched inglorious bastards by Tarantino. I didn't see this film before and it is good movie. I like it. From another side I did almost nothing. I didn't have time for finishing of video. I will do it tomorrow. In general this day was nice.

# 16 April - Sunday - Yerevan - 199 day of immigration

I finally published another episode of emigration diary. I cut almost a half of material. The source wasn't so good. However I prepared a 6 minutes video which is nice. We also went for a walk today. The weather is perfect. It's last sunday in Yerevan in this season. Very soon, or rather the next saturday we're going to Rome. On the next monday we will be in Barcelona. I don't feel like I am ready, but I really want to go there asap. I need also to withdrawal some euro in the bank and add some documents there. I don't want them to cut my payments because of it. So, the next week will be really short. I also wrote some code today and this is nice. In the beginning of the day I had a task from Ksusha. She asked me to install 3dmax 2023 to laptop. So, I did it. This time it happened much faster. One hour ago I helped Yulya, she is Ksusha's sister with OpenVPN installation. I prepared an account for my server and sent it to her. Now she can proceed sitting on instagram and has fun. tOday I am a nice guy. It happens not so often.

# 17 April - Monday - Yerevan - 200 days of immigration

Today is 200 days since I left Russia finally. It's so interesting itself that I should explain it. Bastard make their shit. I got some cash in my bank today. It was nice and fast. I also did some job and tasks for Drsmile. In the evening I was looking for information about public transport in Rome and Barcelona. We are going there very soon and it's time for preparations. I also had an interview with CTO of Dott company. I prepared answers for questions that he sent to me. It was interesting and nice. Let's see what will be the result. Anyway I did a lot of things and I finally tiered and want to have a rest.

# 18 April - Tuesday - Yerevan - 201 days of immigration

I had two interview today. The first one was with Shift company from France. The second one was with Metro company from Germany. Both of them were quite interesting. Also I had a long conversation with drsmile people. I don't know if I will have some cool continuation with them. Anyway it was positive for me. In the shift interview I was talking to a french speaker. It was hard sometimes to understand him but useful. I don't have an interaction experience with French person. On the second metro interview I was talking to quite old lady from Germany. She has an excellent english speaking skills. I was impressed. The position there is quite hard for me but I tried to be honest with her. I was transparent with her. I have a good mood today. It's not so often thing. So, I hope to have some invites to another interviews. And finally I really want to have an offer. I am tiered I want to go further and faster. Let's see what I will have.

# 19 April - Wednesday - Yerevan - 202 days of immigration

Today I was working on TJ tasks for whole day. I will be on vacation very soon and I need to close as many tasks as possible. Today's interview was cancelled. The guy got covid. I also tried to work with codux tool. It's quite cool thing but I'm not sure that I will use it. In general I doing better. I think it's because of vacation. I'm happy to be free for a while. I still have depressive moments. I absolutely sure that I have something like post-traumatic syndrome. I feel sometimes like I was raped by government. This is awful feeling I would say. Maybe in some moment I will be happy. Now I understand that my happiness is somewhere in the past. I don't like to be this type of immigrant. Basically I am a person with no home. It's very bad. At the same time I feel good now.

# 20 April - Thursday - Yerevan - 203 days of immigration

I feel bad today due to weather. Headache and unstable mood has been bothering me today. I bought sim card and ordered a transfer in Rome. I'm exited about my future trip. I would be happy to change atmosphere for a while. I started diet and I constantly hungry. It's something new for me. Anyway I have to do it becaus I don't like my body shape now. I will be 35 years old in 3 days. It's extremely sad for me. I don't want to become so old but I have to. Due to all this bullshit that happened a year ago I still try to change my mindset. I sill like in previous paradigm that is not good. I feel that everything changed but I don't want it. Again It's not about conservatism or similar shit. It's about changed expectation and plans. I do remember how I started preparation for immigration to Canada. Now I don't think that I will go there. It's a shit.

# 21 April - Friday - Yerevan - 204 day of immigration

So, Today was a last working day before my vacation. I can start chilling =). That's amazing. Tomorrow we age going to Rome. I think that the diary record will be write down in Yerevan. but on Sunday I will make it in the place. I am glad to leave Yerevan for a while. this place is nice but I didn't be in pther countries since Georgia visit. But the most exiting thing is that I will visit EU again. I was there last time almost 3 or 4 years ago in Greece. I thoung that it would be a good start  but than pandemic ruined all my plans. It was sad actually. Especially after my starting work for DR SMILE. I started gaining good amount of money but quarantine ruined my trips. Right now I'm sitting in the bad and it's the latest night here in this apartments. I like the location but apartment is not so cozy that I expected.

# 22 April - Saturday - Yerevan - 205 day of immigration

So, I am sitting in Zvartnots international airport. The call to flight will be soon and I will go to Rome. In general it's quite exited thing. I've been waiting this trip for a quite long time. I left my Yerevan's apartments and leave keys to host. It's sad because I really tiered of changing home. I cannot say that it's very convenient lifestyle for me. I understood that I really need to have a base that I can call as home and use it between my travels. I hope that I will fix this problem soon. I suppose that I am in good position because I have money but not only money matter. Sometimes it's cool to have physiological comfort. I don't have it and it makes me sad. I think I should stop to woaming. I don't remember how is word ныть in english. Anyway, I activated esim card and I hope that it stars working when I am in Rome. Because now I added it to the phone successfully but there is no network. Also I texted to my host that I have a whatsup. So, I will got ot the gate.
