# 01 December - Friday - Berlin - 437 day of immigration

Today I visit the XU office and met all people there. It was nice conversation and onboarding in general. I enjoyed it a lot. It was filly office day but with some cool things. They gave me a working laptop, which is very nice and also they gave me some souvenirs like branded bottle, book, and other things. Additionally they gave me wireless keyboard and mouse control which I will not use probably because it's not so useful. But anyway I took it because I don't refuse anything if people give me something valuable. Also drsmile offboarding is absolutely weird. They didn't send me an email or some list of things that I need to do - nothing. It's very weird. I hope they are ok with it because HR's know about my quitting. Also I sad good buy to my bonus because they just didn't sign any paper and I suppose that they will fuck me. Maybe not, but I will know about it in three of four months probably. The weather in Berlin is very cold which is not good but understandable. Locals are in panic because it's rare -6 degrees. Also I will start to clear my laptop tomorrow. I need to remove a lot of things from the place.

# 02 December - Saturday - Berlin - 438 day of immigration

Today I was near ex-berlin wall where one artist draw a brezhven kissed a leader of DDR. It is extremely famous picture. Also there is a picture of Academic Sakharov that participated in invention of extremely powerful Tzar bomb. In general this place is very interesting. After that we went to a gallery in Nounk√∂ln. What a shitty place I have to say. Additionally I saw in metro a Ukranian guy that tried to fight to a russian that was not ok for this person. What a bullshit. He looked like a gopnik, really. The we came back home. Another shit is that DHL guy decided to deliver our package to some neighbor that we don't know. It's crazy. This order was paid and stuff. I cannot understand this shit, really. How is it possible? I don't believe that it's normal. Tomorrow we are going to visit museum of communication. I expect it to be interesting. Another cool thing is that I writing it using keyboard that my new company gave me. It's cool. Yesterday I forgot to mention that I am on two final stages of interview processes. It's so new and cool. I really like it. It's really hight chance that I will visit Frankfurt next week. I am not going to work there but it's cool.

# 03 December - Sunday - Berlin - 439 day of immigration

The museum of communication was nice. We spent an hour there and it was cool. Also we found a cool vietnamese restaurant. It was tasty and nice. The half of the day we spent at home because each of us has big dept. Tomorrow we are going to sparcasse wich is big german ban. It's needed to us opening an account there in order to get salary. So, I hope it will be smooth. Will see. Also tomorrow is the first working day for me. Sure I had a day on Friday but only tomorrow I will start doing actual things. Basically it will be an onboarding day. I need to fill some information on personio and set up all important environment for work. I hope it will be also easy. laptop they gave me is better than mine but I don't know how it will actually work. It's 14 inches Macbook pro 2021 on m1 processor. I have 13 inches macbook pro 2020 on m1 as well. Also I will have some additional information about future interview and other different cool things.

# 04 December - Monday - Berlin - 440 day of immigration

Today we were in sparkasse and actually they opened an account to me. It's really good news. Also vivid band opened another account which is nice as well. I will go and pull some money to it because I have to pay for the delivery. It's sad but necessary. I still want to have a bank card that will work everywhere inside and outside of Europe. I still cannot understand fully that I am in Germany. It's crazy. In general I cannot say that I totally feel the positive difference. This place is much safer that Russia. It also has a lot of weird problems like transport, service, and so on. At the same time salaries and the middle level of life is much better than in Saint-Petersburg. In Russia everything is absolutely understandable but here people are just better. The guy that was opening an sparkasse account for me was extremely polite and nice. It was surprised by this attitude. It's something very new for me. Anyway, tomorrow I will have to
 do a lot of things. So, Now I need to have a rest. I did a lot of important things today. The onboarding in XU has been being annoying.

# 05 December - Tuesday - Berlin - 441 day of immigration

So, today I was onboarding in XU stuff. I investigated how main things work in their project and also did some minor updates for HR onboarding. ADditionally I decided to correct my way as I usually do every year. I wrote down some objectives that I need to achieve in the next few months. I want to check if I am able to do it. Also I got a call from operations1 and they told me that they closed the position and I will not have a final round in Frankfurt. I am happy about it because they started to be annoying for me. They could not decide if they pay or not for my tickets and hotel. Also I had a final call with moving image company. I hope that this round was successful because they offer quite good position with really good compensation. I like it very much. They are looking for a person that can work as Front-end chapter lead. I would be happy to be there in this position. It's also 50/50 chance that they will reject me. It will be normal. I have job and I am in save position. Also I got the last salary from DR SMILE side and I am happy about it. It's some feeling inside me that I cannot get rid of. It's a unsecure buzz in my soul. It's because of shitty contract with DR SMILE. Now I work according German laws and it should make me more confident but I still don't have this feeling.

# 06 December - Wednesday - Berlin - 442 day of immigration

THis day I spent in the office. I am so tiered that it's really hard to understand. I got some tickets in work today which is nice. Also I was diving deeper to the topic and happy about. Unfortunately I didn't find time for grooming my own schedule. I just didn't have time for it. However it was nice. One interesting case happened to me today. My college that helps me with onboarding is from Iraq. His native language is Iraqi version of Arabic. at the same time he know some universal version of it. So, when we were ordering falafel my this guy started talking to Syrian guys that make this food. These guys gave us some pieces of falafel for free just as a compliment. I really felt how immigration community works. It's so peculiar. Tomorrow I am going to finish with some things. In general I feel how it's hard to do things, but I am trying. I am fighting.

# 07 December - Thursday - Berlin - 443 day of immigration

I was in the office again. Also I felt much better that yesterday. However my mood is not so good. I don't know why to be honest. Maybe because I feel some weird feeling because I don't know German and it makes my live a bit difficult here. So I decided to learn it every fucking day. This is the only way how to remove this damn feeling. Additionally heating system in my apartment stopped working again. I really don't understand what is going wrong. I hope that we will survive this night. I am so want to move to another apartments asap. I hate it. So as you can see I am in bad mood.

# 08 December - Friday - Berlin - 444 day of immigration

Today I was working from home. It's so cool. I understand that socialization is important but being home is much better. However I am going to visit office on Monday. It will be the full day there. In the evening me and Ksusha visited vietnamese restaurant from Michelin list. It was tasty but I will not go to the place again. Too simple food doesn't make sense. Next time I will get something else. Also today I got a physical bank card which is amazing. I am happy about it. Very soon I will get another card from Sparkasse that is also great. After that we will be totally secured in terms of keeping money in Europe. Basically I already have two accounts that is great. Tomorrow we will go to museums and just have some fun in the city. It's also cool. The weather become better and I am also enjoy it.

# 09 December - Saturday - Berlin - 445 day of immigration

Today we were in another contemporary art museum or a hall. This place is on Noekeln district and in the past it was a beer factory and heating house. Honestly I don't know how to text this definitions in English correctly. so, the exhibition there was nice. After that we had to view an apartments but the host fucked us and didn't send a number of house in time. So, we just didn't go there and after visiting of Shopping mall went to Hard Rock cafe. Honestly it's just a shitty place I would say. I will never visit it again. In Yerevan it was much better and more interesting. In general I will never go there except Armenian version. Also I finally bought another backpack that is nice. It looks much better than my old one. I also a bit worried about getting permanent apartments here. It's so shitty. It much harder than I expected. I heard a lot of rumors about it but reality is even harder. It's absolutely uncomfortable situation here with it.

# 10 December - Sunday - Berlin - 446 day of immigration

Today I was in Stasi museum. It's located in ex head quarter of the service. The place is absolutely soviet. Everything is so familiar that it feels crazy. I didn't expect that. At the same time it so cool. Surely Stasi was an evil. All exhibition speaks about it. IT's also a bit crazy because it's not true. However the modern Germany should demonize everything related to DDR and communist's period. I wasn't surprised. Also we did a huge cleaning in our apartments today. Mold is everywhere. It's so disgusting. I cannot understand hoe germans live like that. It's so easy to organize normal ventilation. It's not a rocket science. However it's still a problem here. Also I head that mold problem is typical for Portugal as well. I am also not surprised by this. The weather was much better and warmer despite it was raining for whole day.

# 11 December - Monday - Berlin - 447 day of immigration

I was working in the office today. I spent some time on different tasks. In general I was working on really important things. I updated Algorithms handbook which I really like. The main piece of news today is that I got an invitation to Frontend chapter lead position in movingimage company. Honestly I am so tiered that I just didn't feel anything. It's weird but true. The conditions in their company are much better that in XU. I am scheduling another call with them and I hope to clarify some questions that are not clear. In general I am so tiered that I don't have emotions. However I am good. Tomorrow I will feel much better. I will understand it later.

# 12 December - Tuesday - Berlin - 448 day of immigration

I did a lot of things today. It's wasn't easy. I had a lot of meetings and some things. Also I had an interview for head of engineering position. It was very stupid conversation. I didn't like it. I think that it was absolutely unsuccessful. The most significant thing is that I finally did full set of excesses. I started gaining weight again. It's shitty shit. So I will do some workout twice a week. It's really time for it. So today I did it. Next time is thursday. Tomorrow I will to the office. I need to do some cool things and also to visit B√ºrgeramt that is very close to the place. So I also improved some approach for my handbook which is also nice.  I am also very excited about it. It's something new and cool. I fixed a layout issue today and it looks much better right now. In general I feel better now. tomorrow it might be different. Will see.

# 13 December - Wednesday - Berlin - 449 day of immigration

The office day was today. I was alone in the huge open space room. At the same time I had a lot of meetings. In general the day was nice. I visited b√ºrgeramt one more time and ordered a certificate of good attendance. It will be sent in to me soon and I expect to get it in two weeks. Also I filled another statement for one of real estate agency for getting an view of apartments. Also we are expecting to view another place near the city center. I am curious if someone will invite us. I hope that it will happen. The most significant and weird thing for me in Berlin that majority of apartments are without furniture. It's not so often thing. At the same time it's a chance to buy everything you like and live in your own comfort. but everything is so expensive that I don't know if I want to rent some of apartments here.

# 14 Dezember - Donnerstag - Berlin - 450 Tag der Einwanderung

So, I decided to start marking days and other things in German here. Maybe one day I will switch to this language here. I hope that one day my English knowledge will be enough for just having it in mind as default skill. Also I finished reading book series Strazh by Pehov. It was incredible. I have not read so cool fantasy books in Russian for very long time. It was amazing. If you know Russian you should definitely read it. I enjoyed it and you will do it as well. In general this day was nice but heavy. I feel very tiered but cannot do anything with it. A lot of things should be done. The apartments question destroys and annoys. In this situation I can only try to do things and not more. Tomorrow it Freitag and I am happy about it. I am going to a local barber this morning and this is also cool. I hope that that place will be nice. Will see. Right now I don't know. Tomorrow I will text about it here.

# 15 Dezember - Freitag - Berlin - 451 Tag der Einwanderung

Today I visited a barbershop so it was not a perfect experience as fo me. Surely specialists for eastern Europe and caucas much better. The price was hight, the outcome wasn't so. Unfortunately I also lost in Berlin today. I put other address to google maps accidentally. Luckily this mistake didn't const me anything. I was in the place in time. After that I was working for whole day. I had a call with movingimage and I can sat that it was absolutely bad experience. Their CTO was on a call and it was not only weird but confusing. I didn't like it. They also cut benefits they proposed and it was also a bad sign. Besides that I really didn't like the CTO and how he talked to me. It was not only strange but absolutely disrespectful. I don't want to work in such environment really. My impressions of team was great but this guy wasn't nice. In the evening me and Ksusha visited a Peruan restaurant in Berlin which is in Michelin catalog. The portions were really small but expensive but the quality of dished were amazing. I enjoyed it so much. also there work a trans boy that looks like a real girl. I saw such person for the first time in my life. It's really good that this kind of people can live here without any problems and judges from others.

# 16 Dezember - Samstag - Berlin - 452 Tag der Einwanderung

Today we were walking in the city. We were at Zoologischer Garten U-bahn station. We spent some time in the cafe working. Also the server in the place was a girl from Ukraine. It was interesting. Also in the morning we viewed an apartments in Wedding district. It was perfect but unfortunately very expensive for us. It was so bad really. In other case I would rent them immediately. It was really cool. Anyway we have another view tomorrow. I hope it will be not so bad. On monday we have a view of apartment that are not so close to our current living place. Finger crossed. In the middle of the day we were in another part of Berlin. Actually we made a mistake and visited wrong place but also a bit interesting. By the way, if we had not gone there, we would not have gotten to the sale of paintings by some local artists. In the evening Ksusha cooked interesting bread with camembert cheese.

# 17 Dezember - Sonntag - Berlin - 453 Tag der Einwanderung

Today we looked at another apartment. It was so bad. I would not like to live there. It's insane. The architecture of building is terrifying. It looks like –¶–ö–ë on Russia. It's extremely unconformable and coziness is below than zero. Also unfortunately we have to cancel yesterday's apartments. The place was really cool. I liked it so much but there is no money in my wallet for it. After that we spent some time on a cafe. After that visited some weird mordern market. But the coolest thing was vising of Berlins museum of history. First there are huge dinosaurs. It was cool. Also this place has big collection of everything. I enjoyed it so much. In the evening we just came back home. Tomorrow I will have another two view of apartments. I am not sure that it will be successful. I don't know. I hope to rent one of them.

# 18 Dezember - Montag - Berlin - 454 Tag der Einwanderung

We were only on one view of apartments. Unfortunately two of them were to far from the city center. and some of theme were too expensive. The apartment we visited was absolutely awful. It's a perfect place to die. Tomorrow we are going to another view of apartments that looks much more promising. The place is in Wedding district which is quire good. I don't want to live in long distance from the city center. I am sure that I will be able to get much more money and it's not a big deal for me. At the same time I don't know when I can do it. It's really tricky. Besides that DR SMILE is finally blocked my email. They did it after 18 days after my leaving. It's not a surprise. I don't know why all their it systems work so bad. It's just weird.

# 19 Dezember - Dienstag - Berlin - 455 Tag der Einwanderung

Days that filled by meeting are always hard. Discussion about some new XU architecture took 5 hours. I don't like it in general, but today I enjoyed. Maybe it's just because the project is still new for me. Also we viewed another apartments today. The place is really good. I would really happy to settle there. It is ok for my budget and it's cool. Surely there is nothing. No internet, not electricity - nothing. There is no bad even. It pushes me to find new ways for getting more money. I think only about it. It's really uncomfortable to be in this situation. As usual I am die hard. I will do everything. If it's necessary I will go to another country. I have only one life. I am about to start learning in Y combinator school. I want to recall everything about building startups. It's the only way to get a lot of money.

# 20 Dezember - Mittwoch - Berlin - 456 Tag der Einwanderung

Today I finally star
