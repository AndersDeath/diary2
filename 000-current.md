# 01 December - Thursday - Gündoğan - 63 day of immigration

Today is 2 months since i left Russia. I still feel bad. I really dream about a moment when I can be in good mood and calm. I feel that I am extrimely tiered of the situation. I know that much more people in worse situation that me, but I feel it as it is. I am also extrimely tiered of the working for DR SMile. It seems that I am very close to be burned out. 

Despite the my mood I try to do things in time. I go through my todolist, don't forget about lessons, and try to study something everyday. I try to find stability in my mind, but honestly I feel everything so useless. I don't want live in this shit.

Sometimes I even think about going back to Russia and trying to find job there. Only fear of death holds me from it. I think I need to come up with some strategy for future asap. In other case I will go crazy. 

Only one thing exists - everything will be ok. I believe in it.

# 02 December - Friday - Gündoğan - Turgutreis - 64 day of immigration

It's really cool that we got new jaket for Ksusha today. The thing we had going to Turgutreis for it. But this is no a problem. The problem is absence of jaket. The Turgutreis bus was filled by young studenst of local Gundogan school. Surprisingy the behaived well. Alsot because of the 20 000 000 revenew of DR SMILE I have a half day off. It's really funny, but I am grad to have it anyway. From studying perspective I got rhetorics of story lessons. it's was interesting and quite well. Unfortunately it wa the only thing that I've done today. Finally I posted a new video. It's good becasue I didn't have time for editing it. I like to record all that stuff, it is like therapy for my. Also I had to finish my math lessons and probably I will finish with Portugal ones as well. The probem is that i don't have time for it. Maybe in the future I will come back to them. But now It's imposible. I think I can focus on Ukranian. It's quite easier that absolutly new language that didn't learn before. Also it's more convinient to learn something from the same family. Tomorrow we are going to Bodrum for the last time. we will go to istanbul and then to Yerevan on the next week

# 03 December - Saturday - Gündoğan - Bodrum - 65 day of immigration

The very last weekend in Bodrum has been started. We are going back to Istanbul in the next wednesday. We said good buy to Bodrum today and to Turgutreis yesterday. Tomorrow I will try to record the last video here in Gundogan. Newermind. Today we discussed my new CV. There is something for working. I will change several lines there on the next week. In general today I had a free day. I did something, but mostly not so important. I decided to groom my guthup repositories, but I have a lot of them. I started putting all this stuff to a notion table, but i was tiered of this and decided to make a script. so, now I have 117 repositories, it's too much. tomorrow I will try to proceed working on it. yeap. Returning to the original topic, I'm glad I'm leaving. It's quite a village. I'm tired of this place

# 04 December - Sunday - Gündoğan - 66 day of immigration

The very last weekend in Gundogan has been finished. The day after tomorrow we will flight to Istanbul, where we will be for two days and then go back to Yerevan. Honestly, I am glad about it. Also I will take day off on wednesday in order to walk in istanbul. Also I tried to record a video today. I've made a lot of variats. It was really hard to do, but I decided that I have to do it. finally I went to the roof and recorded video there. I don't know if that shots are good, but I have only them. Also I tried final cut pro, and honestly it much better that imovie. It's a piece of shit. I finally finished with new opening for videos, it's some kind of cover to immigrant song. I repeated drum pattern there. Then I found that if you record video on iphone using macbook as a station if the last one goes to sleep mode video recoding just freezing. It's absolutely bullshit I think. But maybe it's again for privacy mode. The another important thing is that I finished with a script that fetches all data about reposfrom github and push them into notion table. It's amazing beacuse the script is exttrimely simple and everyone can repeat it. I dring an alcohol the third day in the row. I strarted doing it on friday. I started bottle of beer, yesterday I got a glass of wine, today I got a bottle of beer again. I don't like this. i am extrimely nervouse. It's sad.

# 05 December - Monday - Gündoğan - 67 day of immigration

Today I wasn't be able to do a lot of things. the whole day was dedicated to call and meetings. It wasn't so good, but I had no choice. Today's noght is last here. tommorow we are going to flight to Istanbul. I learned some management, english and Ukranian today. Please don't ask me why I learned the last one. It's just beacuse I had a good mood. Also I brought a Ksushas jaket to a tailor. He fixed is and now it's well. I don't remember if I mentioned it before, but Ksusha and me bought a jacket for her on the local on-line market and it had a manufacturing defect. So, we decided to charge back and push this shit back to the shop, but just fixed it my ourselves. Today I also need to pack all my luggege and prepared everything for tomorrow's trip. I am happy that I will go to another place, but again, it will a stress. I would be happy to find my own place. Otherwise I will go crazy. Surely I have gypsy blood, but it's not cool to live this way. I really want to have home.

# 06 December - Tuesday - Gündoğan - Istanbul - 68 day of immigration

So, We checked out from the house. Now I am sitting in Bodrum's airport and waiting for boarding. Baaiacally I studied some cool things today and the rest of the time was dedicated to packing things in luggage. honestly I am glad to leave this place but ath the same time I fell lazyness. I just don't wanto to do anything. today I whatched important videos about how to understand storytelling muli act system. It was very interesting and I event dounloaded script of Alien movie for analysis. I don't want to be professional in these area but It woould be cool to adapt some interesting things for my future video. currently they don't have neither structure nor sense. I really want to fix it. 

# 07 December - Wednesday - Istanbul - 69 day of immigration

Tpday we visited museum of Gaza here. It's quite interesting place and ex-coal electic station. Almost all exibitions were close exept the main one that is about climate changes. At the same time library and cafe were opened. After that we went to shopping mall. We bought some good for Ksushas sister. Ther we used metro and went to Istiklal. We bought goods there as well, visited Starbaks and had a good time. I took photos from ex-terroristik act place. It's interesting that there is no evidences of tragedy. I think it's good tactics. They wanted to scare people. but they just dont's react. The we came back to the house. I can say that the apartment is not so good as it is on pictures. Luckily we will go away tomorrow. Honestly I am very glad to be here again. It's a nice place and city. it's much more better than Bodrum area. However I feel tiered. Yesterday's flight was quite quick and ewasy. Only hard thing is to carry all our luggege. It's really heavy. My steps are in pain. Tomorrow we are going to work for whole day and only after that move to airport and Yerevan. I've made a full day off fot myself today. I did nothing exeprt walking and shopping. It was amaizing. Winter's Istanbul looks like Rome in some point. I really like it. Sometimes I feel how I want to live here and don't move to another place, but I know that is quite impossible becaouse It's hard to live legally here. By the way the weather is fine here. It's not so cold and I event don't need to wear winter shoese. I also called to my mom today. Everything is fine with her. It's cool.

# 08 December - Thursday - Istanbul - Yerevan - 70 day of immigration

Today I am gonig to Yerevan. I cannot say that something significant happened today. I just was working on important things. For example I did some improvements for DR SMILE. also I proceded preparation for future job seeking. I was working on cleaning of code. I finally will get new apple headphones today which is amazing. It's interesting but I got good feelings today about my future. It's wiered becasue it dosn't have evidencies for it. I still dreaming about obtaining of my future home. It's not surprise that It's imposible for now. I still been thinking about US. It's not the best country but I don't see better place. The was is still here. Mda.

# 09 December - Friday - Yerevan - 71 day of immigration

I am in Yerevan. Fortunately, The flight was nice and not so long. Typical problem here is that houses in Yerevan are extrimely cold. It's really hard to be even in Apartments without bad feeling. however it's a heater and it helps to be in relative norm. Three hours time shift with Berlin interferes yet. I wasnt in good condition for all day. It was very debilitating day. By the way, I started using ipods pro and this is amaizing thing. The quality of sound is quite good and anti-noize mode is amazing,

# 10 December - Saturday - Yerevan - 72 day of immigration

I slept quite well and it was good. in the first part of the day I met Oleg and it was amazing because I evet thought that will not see each other for very long time. Let me remind you that he was supposed to immigrate to Canada, but due to problems on their side, the process slowed down. So, I see that all things that western countries say are just a bullshit. I bought parfume and warm socks. Now I am sitting and trying to write down someting interesting.

## 11 December - Sunday - Yerevan - 73 day of immigration

Today I woke up at 8 am in good mood. I did a lot of things in the morinig. I finally finished with the latest video from Turkey. Crrently it's uploading to youtube. i will publish it tomorrow. Yesterday we were in the cinema. Artpokaz showed Pulp Fiction by Tarantino. I really like this movie especially in Enlish. Surely there were subtitles on the screen. i groomed my CV today. Probably it's the final editing of it. The last thing that I need to do is determing of salary range that I want to achieve. It's complicated but insanely important. I also forgod to mention several thing during last days. The firts one that I got an order from ASOS and now I have new incredible bagpack, which is very cool. the second I got some clovthes from ASOS. Third thing that I bought new parfume. Fourth thing that I want to start working on diary app prototype. It should be secure and safe thing. Sixth is that I scheduled podolog doctor for fixing problems with my feet.

# 12 December - Monday - Yerevan - 74 day of immigration

Today I did a lot of things. Unfortunately it's again to hard to make a notarial power of attorney. I improved some code for my own goals and for drsmile. The most part of the day I was coding. I fell not so good. I don't have enoguht power for doing something. Again, it's not so easy.

# 13 December - Tuesday - Yerevan - 75 day of immigration

I ran out for whole day. Firstly I visited podolog and she prescribed some shots into musles. I want heal my nails on feet. After that I was in translater office and she will prepare some things for me and it's amizing. Very soon I will apply for social card here. I need it for getting temporary residency here. Also I had several calls including interview with Product designer. She wan't so good but has potention. Luckly we have several persons in the row. I will have another interiew tomorrow. That's very nice. Besides that I analized some important things about my project which will help me in the future. Now I am going to shopping mall in order to buy contact lences for Ksusha. Wildberries delay delivery that is shit. Ksusha cannot do anything without that lences. She has worse eyes than me.

# 14 December - Wednesday - Yerevan - 76 day of immigration

Today I got a translation of the passport and tomorrow I will ask for social card. If the translation of notary statement is ready I will go to Notary office and do things. It everything is ok, all these documents will be in Russia next week. That's awesome. The rest of the time I was working in DR sMiLE tasks and also I imprivede github-notion script. Ksusha will go to Russia very soon and I will do all things during her absens. The host came todat to us and fixed door to bathroom. honestly this week is crazay I almost do things in time that is very difficult. Luckily it's really big chance that I will finish everything tomorrow.

# 15 December - Thursday - Yerevan - 77 day of immigration

# 17 December - Saturday - Yerevan - 79 day of immigration

Ksusha has been flew to Russia today. It's the fisrt time in our lives when we will deparated for a week. Honestly I feel bad because of it. We spent a great day. We had a nice luch with pizze in Syrovarya. We walked a lot today. Currently shee is somewhere above Russia in an airplane. I feel bad, need to say it one more time. I fixed not a lot of thoughts here for the last several days. It's because I don't have mood for it. But I need to write down several things.

1. We had to be on the cinema yestarday. Unfortunately there happened a bad thing. We wanted to enter to the hall with food and staff stopped us. tickets were very expencive and we decided not to go there and wrote a statemet for refund. I think if you pay so much money you need to have possibility to enter with everything that we want.
2. We leave our apartments in the city center. Moving was successfull and I am sitting in other one now.
3. I got all documents for getting temporary residency. It's amazing. 
4. Also I will wait for Ksushas landing today.

# 18 December - Sunday - Yerevan - 80 day of immigration

TToday was not a bad day. i feel empty because of Ksusha's absence. I woke up and wend to SAS food cord. I got some food there. The I did noting and just had a rest. Afternoon I met Oleg and had a great conversation with him. In general I just listned to the music, videos and played Diablo 2. It's absolutely rare situation when I played games. Usuallhy I don't do it, becasue the life is much more interesting then vistual worlds. Tomorrow I will work hard on everything that I need to finish. It's very simple. I don't have even motivation for walking and doing anything except work. 

# 19 December - Monday - Yerevan - 81 day of immigration

I did almost nothing today. The reason is simple. It's really depressive for me to be without Ksusha. I didn't have a water today. It was pretty annoying. It couldn't flush the toilet. I textd to my host and she told me that there was a problem in the house. So, I went to buy some water. Sadly all drinkig water was bought by locals and I had to go to a far away supermarket. While I was goint to the shop the problem with liquid in the apartment was fixed. Due to this I have a lot of drinking water now. Also I decided to stop wantching and reading everything in Russian. I know that it's not the first time when I decided to do this, but today I blocked some websites on my comuter in order to achive this goal. It's interesting how things will to be going tomorrow. I still try to achive challare 365 day's of git commits. this day is actuall is 355th. It's good thing because after that I want to achive 500 days. It's absolutely doesn't make sense, but it's just fun for me. I also going to record another video tomorrow. I like to do it and now when I am alone it's good therapy. I hate to be alone and easily loose concentration and motivation. So, I am going to sleep shortly. Have a good night fellows. See you tomorrow.

# 20 December - Tuesday - Yerevan - 82 day of immigration

I met Oleg and we walked in the city center. All other day I dedicated to the work. Honestly it's hard for me to write somethnig.

# 22 December - Thursday - Yerevan - 84 day of immigration

Jira didn't work today. It's crusial thing for DR SMiLE. It's a bullshit that they didn't pay for it. At the same time I code a lot today. I didn't have time for recording new video unfortunately. I hope that tomorrow I will do it. Also I will to KT tomorrow morning. 

# 23 December - Friday - Yerevan - 85 day of immigration

I met Oleg today and it was extrimely important because I don't know when I will see him next time. Moreover I saw his mother because she went to Yerevan in order to meet him. That's amazing. Also from the second try I got a KT. it's also good because I can go to a doctor with it. This is very important for my future efforts to fix teeth. From another side I did a lot of programming stuff today. The special prototype of telegram bot that will help me to learn armenian alphabet is also done. I called it as hayastan-assistant. I walked a lot today, it was also good. After that I am tiered of my look. I stopped wearing electronic whatches and started using analogues one. it's absolutely new step for me. Tomorrow is saturday when I can dedicate the whole day for recording new video. I rally want to do it. It will be the last opportunity for me. I want to record the results of the year. I will write down a plan using my knowlage about rhetorics. I want to prepare Russian and English versions. It will be amazing if I can do both videos tomorrow. also i need to finish with some tasks that i could ffinish this week. So I concider this week as very silly and lazy. I will go back to usual pace from tomorrow. 

# 24 December - Saturday - Yerevan - 86 day of immigration

Today I walked a bit and ate a lot. it was a good day. I published HEIC to jpeg converter in github. I am going to use this stuff for a while. Also this saturday is the final day without Ksusha. she is going coming back to Yerevan. It was a calm and empty week without her. I will meet her at airport tomorrow at 8pm approximetly. After that we will go to some restaraunt and have a dinner. Also I started writing script for the next video. I am going to finish it tomorrow morning and maybe record the video.

# 25 December - Sunday - Yerevan - 87 day of immigration

I woke up in time tiday I had a good rest. After that I went to the city center for a walk and had good lunch in Sarriso. Just after that went home and was working on the new video. I will probably finish with it during the week. I need to finish with the text and then record the video. I captured some material today, but it's not good, I think, but maybe I will cut it and make good stuff.
