# 01 September - Thursday - Saint-Petersburg

The conflict with Marat has gone. The day was rainy and cold. I was working on many many things. Honestly I fell tiered and broken. Short night will make me better.

# 02 September - Firday - Saint-Petersburg

The wheather became better and it affected my productivity. I did sport, meditation, language learning and a bit product thinking lessons. Also I want to dive deeper into business. i think I've finished with main pieces of ng-firebase-auth project and can proceed on building some kind of simple business idea there. Probably links storage or simple todo list will be fine. Also I am going to start working on article. The basis for it is already finished. I need to formilize all that shit and do my best. I think following to rules that I figure out for myself several years ago pushes my effitiency now only. But i am happy that I feel it and do better everything. also I think to become ruthless in order to achieve even more

# 03 September - Saturday - Saint-Petersburg

Today is just free day. We went to the city center again. We were in Vasiliostrovsky market which was reconstructed several years ago and became a food court. Currently this place has a lot of restaraunts for different tastes. After that we walked through the city center and visited Novaya Gollandia, which is a important culture center in Saint-Petersburg. Then we get a trolleybus and went home. At the same time we bought a dinner in Vkusno i Tochka - ex-Macdonalds. Big tastie is absolutly the same like in the past. They didn't change anything. Only coca-cola has gone from this place. now we are preparing for driving to gulf of finland. I really enjoy that place and will be happy to visit it again. Ksusha is takling to her mother by phone while I am writing these lines. Oh, I've just recolled. I've changed a structure of this diary. Now I separated everything by months and numbers. It's cool for sorting information. At the same time I have couple words about yesterday's evening. After jiob we went for a walk to Chernishevskaya and were in interecting yard. It's called Mozaic yard. It's quite beautiful place. If you are in Saint-Petersburg you  should defenetly visit this place. After we walked a bit and went home. By the way i staerted reading of Garry Potter in Ukranian. It's cool. I do it for practice and I also want to know Ukranian better. Now I only can read and listent to speach in this language but cannot speak by myself. Actually I do not understand meaning of some words as well. Another inportant thing that ukranian is a laguage of my ancestors and I just want to know it better. So, I also extrimely tiered i am dreaming about sleep.

# 04 September - Sunday - Saint-Petersburg

I've recorded a very nice pppodcast. Nastya gave us (me and K.) tickets to Manezh. There was a exibition of Leningrad's painters of 20th centuary. At the same time there was a post-chorus event. It was some kind of music band. They sand different modern songs acapello and with beat boxing on the background. It wasn't huge from musical side, but interection as a culutural event. Then we went back home, ate dinner and drove around neigbourhood by car. We talked a lot about islam, because K. ex-best frieds turned to that religion and Ksusha has a conversation with her today. Fortunately everything is fine with her, but all that she sad were strange. maybe becaouse I am an anti-religous person. Also I significantly improver ng-firebase-auth project. Essentialy everythin is ready for article. Tomorrow I will stard to decompose it by parts. Now I am going to dring tea and to read book a bit. I think it will be Harry Potter in Ukranian.

# 05 September - Monday - Saint-Perersburg

Actually Today I did a lot of work. ng-firebase-auth is ready I am goind to write text shortly. Maybe even tomorrow it depends on current problems. At the same time I've got an idea about daily standup manager. It's just something like daily tool where you can track information about current problems, tasks, ideas, etc. It is the idea about custom tool for very small teams. It's smaller that Jira and it's not trello like tool. Also I've dived into dental topics, because I really want to figure out how to save the mobile application within DRSMILE. Surely it mostly depends on stackeholders, but maybe I can find something. Today is a coffe day. Also I did some maths and management tasks. I am trying to proceed with all that sruff. Meditation and yoga excersices are also done. maybe we will go for a walk in the evening. I still do not know. it's about 15 minutes until working day end.

# 06 September - Tuesday - Saint-Perersburg

This day was wuite usuall. I did nothing new. I had a plan to start writing an article, but I couldn't do this. It's not because I am lazy, but I just do not have power for it. I think I will do this tomorrow. I also thought a lot about replication of that ng-firebase-auth, but for React. I event created a new repository. Sadly, I've just done it and that's it. I was working mostly on a lot of tickets in DR SMILE and did stuff for myself. In partucular, I've published know from the future piece of news onto my telegram channel. I am going to have a dinner now and then probably go for a walk. I do not know, let's see. Only one thing I forgot that I need to order a new MIR card in Sber. Probably it will be useful for me in our journey. Also Ksusha bought all tickets and booked apartments for us in Turkey and Egypt. it will be my first visit to this african country and in continental part of that land. Prevously I was on Seyshell islands. It's also Africa but it's very unique place. So, I need to finish for today. i am not in good mood, I need to have a rest. 

# 07 September - Wednesday - Saint-Perersburg

So, yesterday we got caught in heavy rain. it's absolutely tipical weather for Saint-Petersburg in this part of the year. But, anyway we got a good time in the icty center. today i woke up and already did yoga and got a shower. Today I also had a lot of meetings. I've investigated topic about sirvey engine creation. The repository is ready and tomorow I will start do implementatin. After all we wnet ot Mednoye ozero which is not so far from our home. Usually it's quite crowdy place with tons of people. but now it is absolutely empty place. at the same time it is very beatiful lake, I wasn't there before. So, it was just cool to visit it and put into my visited places list.
