# 01 February - Wednesday - Yerevan - 125 day of immigration

Today I recorded a video. When I have time I will edit it and publish. It will be another episode of Immigration Diary. I met a lawyer that will help me with documents. I trained computer science. I don't remember maybe I mentioned it before, I decided to switch my focus to engineering things. I also had a uber call yesterday. Staff engineering position is not so interesting for me, but I will try to pass at least one interview. I am not sure that I will handle it, but who knows. Tomorrow I will probably go to doctor in order to get a certificate of health for permanent residency card. I hope it will be ok. However I need to groom my schedule and understand if I really can go there tomorrow. I will check it shortly. 

# 02 February - Thursday - Yerevan - 126 day of immigration

Today I finished with the first test from Booking. I hope that I did well and everything is good. Also the new backend developer started working with us, which is amazing thing. I did several exercises. I've been preparing myself for potential layoffs. It will be very sad if happens. At the same time I do everything for compensation of all this things. Tomorrow I am going to policlinic in order to get health certificate. It's necessary for getting residency permit. At the same time I am tiered of everything. I know that my diaries sometimes sound like moans, but It is as it is. It's hard time. The mood it not good despite the fact that I had the test and will have another interviews with Uber very soon. I feel on the edge. It's fake, I know, but I cannot be calm. You can find in my previous notes that I sometimes can be in good mood. Unfortunately it's not about this year. Everything goes very strange in shady direction.

# 03 February - Friday - Yerevan - 127 day of immigration

Today I got a health certificate in the hospital. It's necessary for getting residency. Basically this process ate the whole day. However I did something and improved some things in my projects. Ksusha went to the manicure master and I am alone here. She also bought tickets to Russian. She's going to Saint-P and Rzhev in March probably. I really want to go back home. I really want to live in normal country. Fucking Putin has stolen my home. Don't want to write anything else. The mood is awful.

# 04 February - Saturday - Yerevan - 128 day of immigration

Today I have a full day off. This is amazing. I decided that having at lest one day off is amazing idea. Usually I cannot do it because my mind isn't free and light. I always have some kind of weight on my shoulders which makes me a not so nice person in some points. Today we are going to the cinema. It will be Big Lebovski in English. I really like that movie and will be happy to watch it again. Every day I learn computer science and it's interesting for me. It's much better that I thought.  Moreover because of starting writing holy theory I have to dive into the topic. Maybe in the future I really finish the book and because a bit famous. It's still a shame for me to dream about fame, but I cannot refuse it. I want it. Partially I decided to record videos because of it. It's really interesting thing. I want to have good acquaintances that can help me in achieving my goal. It's enough for today. See you people.

# 05 February - Sunday - Yerevan - 129 day of immigration

The last day of weekend was also cool. It was quite calm and without anything significant. I bought a new hoody which is nice. ow, Yesterday we were on the big lebowski movie. It was quite nice and interesting. I live this film and was happy yo watch it once again. I finished with editing of youtube video that I want to publish tomorrow. It's the best thing that I did for all period of time. For unknown reasons the rendering was interrupted by error. Something happened with fonts. I don't know what is that thing exactly because I use standard fonts there. I will try handle this shortly. Also I published the first shorts video on youtube. Let's talk a bit about programming. today I was working on resolving matrix algorithms. My brain is not so good and it was really hard to recall all those things about matrix, how to fill it correctly or turn it to 90 degrees to right. All this shit will be in the holy theory. I will publish a new article about it tomorrow.

# 06 February - Monday - Yerevan - 130 day of immigration

I did great thing I met my Lower she will bring my documents to OVIR tomorrow. This is very good. Also I fixed Ksushas boots. The master was cheap and it's good. A sad thing also happened. My beloved Pixel 3xl has a blown battery. At the same time I had cool calls with my team. Today happened another bad thing. it's earthquacke in Turkey that killed many people there. Even Batumi, Cyprus and Turkey - Armenian border felt this thing. I called to my mom. Luckily everything is good with her. I don't have time to make calls often. I feel bad because of it. I did yoga and meditation this morning. That was cool.
