# 01 November - Wednesday - Yerevan - 398 day of immigration

Today I was working on entities for my nx setup. It was interesting and nice. I'm going to finish working on it. BRsided that I was learning German and doing other things. I pissed off of dR SMILE. These morons didn't send money to me again. It makes me really angry. I really want to finish working for them as soon as possible. I pissed off. Also I found how to reach out railway station in Dortmund. It will be easier than I expect because this place has shuttle bus from airport to railway station. It's really nice and not so expensive. Just 10 euros and I am there. In general my vacation goes smooth. I have time to work on many things I spend this time smart. Also me and Ksusha were in cafe today. We got lunch and worked from that place. In couple of minutes we will go to the cinema. Yep, Vacation goes well. I like it.

# 02 November - Thursday - Yerevan - 399 day of immigration

I feel very angry for an unknown reasons. It's been happening since yesterday. It's really simple for me to go out of temper. I don't like it but cannot do anything with it. It's just needed to be mentioned. Also we were in the cinema yesterday in the evening. we watched Killers of the Flower Moon. It's a movie about white americans that were ready for everything for getting oil fields from native americans. It's really powerful picture. I highly recommend to look at it. Today I was doing usual things according my daily plan.Additionally I build a special version of telegram bot that helps me in learning of german words. It was important thing. Also I visited my Podologist, maybe last time. I am not sure that I will got to get at 14 of November. Probably I will just cancel this schedule. Tomorrow I will proceed working on my usual things.

# 03 November - Friday - Yerevan - 400 day of immigration

Oh, 400th day of my immigration. It's interesting. 400 days ago I understood that the war will not end and I have to leave the country. Before that I considered Yerevan as a temporary place for work and waiting for collapse of Russian army, but the war is still here. Also Palestine and Israel are fighting to each other. It's absolutely scary situation. I feel like the world got crazy. But let's go back to me. I did a lot of things today. I woke up early in the morning. I was editing the barcelona video, added some updated to holy theory, and was working on other things. Unfortunately at least the half of my vacation ended. It's sad. Other this is that in two week we will be in Germany. It's crazy. I still cannot believe in it. I will be a complete immigrant. It's so crazy. I don't understand if it's good or bad. It's something new. I am excited and scared at the same time. The completely new life will start for me and Ksusha. It's crazy. I realized that I cannot feel it normally. Some weird emotions come to me.

# 04 November - Saturday - Yerevan - 401 day of immigration

THis day was nice. Ksusha did a surgery today. She decided to fix a shape of one of her ears. Fo some reasons she didn't like it. I visited my dentist today and she assured me that everything is ok with my teeth for now. It's good. She also sent me a contact of one woman that lives in Germany and she is dentist as well. Unfortunately she lives in one hour by train. Knowing that Europe is so small I don't afraid of it. So, Now I am going to order a dinner and then I will go for a walk. Ksusha cannot go anyplace because of the bandage on the ear. So, today I will walk alone. Also I need to edit Barcelona video today probably. I will do it right after finishing writing this note. It's so crazy that I keep writing this diary. It's so interesting. I didn't calculate days that were described here but I do it since april 2022. I started doing it after the beginning of the war just for therapy and I can say that it works. I feel much better. The fact that I can describe everything fairly makes me happy. Maybe someone will read these lines. It would be fun. Also it's interesting if i generate a pdf file with all these notes how much pages will it be? One day I will try to do it.

# 05 November - Sunday - Yerevan - 402 day of immigration

The main thing for today is that I decided to stop the run for commit numbers to github. I realized recently that I make about 50 commits daily with no sense. Simply I do a lot of absolute weird things for no reason. So, I want to keep solid streak in gh but I don't want to have thousands commits yearly. It's just stupid. In general this day was nice. We went for a walk with Ksusha for some long period of time and visited a couple of nice places. She feels good but the ear still pains. It hope that the recovery process will be fine and everything is good soon. Additionally I prepared a plan for tuesday's meetings with people about my leaving of the company. It's good to have a schema of conversation. I like it very much. Another weird thing is that we will be in Berlin in 11 days. Crazy. Also I finished Barcelona video. I will prepare everything for publishing tomorrow and it will appear on my youtube channel finally. Also I want to record another video tomorrow. It will be long shoot about my current situation. It will be a real diary I suppose. I am going to visit surgeon tomorrow and right after this I will record a video. it's cool because I will have at least a week and a half for editing and publishing it. After that I will record another one in Berlin. So, yes. Staying in Yerevan is about to finish.

# 06 November - Monday - Yerevan - 403 day of immigration

Today my dentist removed stitches and I am happy about it. I can return my sport activities tomorrow. I am also happy about it. Fortunately the next surgery will be in several months which is amazing. surely I need to restore my smile but I am so tiered of it. The main thing for today is that I finished with damn Barcelona video. It's done. It's so cool people, you cannot imagine how I am happy about it. Tomorrow I will record another video. The thing is that I will say to my colleges about my leaving tomorrow and in this video I will tell about it to everybody else. It's cool. However my main focus now is to finish the article. I decided to focus on it. It will be cool. I was talking to my mother and I got bad news about one person from their circle. He was found dead in the bus recently. Nobody knows what is the reason of his death. Probably it's alcoholism. From other sides the day was nice. Tomorrow will be even better.

# 07 November - Tuesday - Yerevan - 404 day of immigration

I finally informed DR SMILE about my leaving. Everybody got this piece of news well. It wasn't a surprise for anyone. So, my motivation package will be payed to me in March next year probably. It's annoying but I cannot do anything with it. It's just a thing that is in the process now. Overall I will keep some money on Armenian account due to have some money separation. Will see. I am sure that there is some cool solution that I can use. Also I got a medical plan from my dentist. For fixing all my smile I need another 7000 euro. It's quite huge sum. Sad thing actually. However it will be the best materials and treatment that I can find anywhere. My smile will look like in holywood style not like a toilet. Also from tomorrow I will start transition period that will be smooth I suppose and nice. The new chapter of my life will start soon. This is nice.

# 08 November - Wednesday - Yerevan - 405 day of immigration

Things go nice. Today I announced my quit to the team. Transition period has started. It's important to do everything well and in time. Additionally I signed a rent contract for the temporary apartment in Berlin. It's also cool and nice. We will have a place for two and half months. Again it's amazing. somehow we need to find a permanent place soon. At the same time from tomorrow I will dedicate much more time to my personal things. All emotional events are done. I have only week until starting a new iteration of immigration shit. In general today I did a lot of usual things and after that we were walking to SAS for having a dinner. I liked this. Now we are at home having a rest. I am tiered.

# 09 November - Thursday - Yerevan - 406 day of immigration

Today I got 8k euro from bank. We need some cash in Berlin for the first time. So, we decided to do something this way. Also we were walking today in the city center. Additionally I found a way how to terminate a contract with Rostelecom which is nice. I will do this next week. I also finished a lot of things today. The electricity was cut this morning due to some incident. So, I edited the github article significantly because of absence of electricity. The supplying was restored shortly and I did some preparation to another interview today. It was nice. In general day was calm and interesting. I also update telegram bot that helps me with words learning. Tomorrow I will publish the update of it.

# 10 November - Friday - Yerevan - 407 day of immigration

I was working on PDF generation for most part of the day. It still doesn't work well. Unfortunately I see some problems that are not suppose to be solved easily. It's really sad. However I've been working hard on it. I want to automatizate the building process of the book. It's my main goal. Also I was resolving some issues on DR SMILE side. The shit happened with google play. They wanted to get some demo account and I just sent one to them. It's annoying. The system when you need to do some demo shit just because the want to see something is awful. I don't like this approach to moderation. From other side the day was pretty usual and calm. Nothing new. We are still in preparing to migration. We are going to Germany next friday. Only one week is left here for us. The time runs pretty quickly.

# 11 November - Saturday - Yerevan - 408 day of immigration

Today we said good buy to local Yerevan's Hard Rock cafe. Unfortunately there is no chance to eat there again this staying in Yerevan. I have cheat meal only by Saturdays. At the same time I have a huge head ache for the whole day. IT's so bad. I feel bad. I got ibuprofen pill, maybe it will help. Cold season is yerevan's area is very polluted. The city is staying in some kind og low area between mountains and when there is no wind all smoke from houses and cars staying just here in the air. You constantly feel this shit and it's also painful for me because I have headache because of the smoke. Last year and two years ago I felt the same.

At the same time the day was nice. We did everything we wanted and enjoyed the city that was out shelter for some time. Yerevan will be in my heart forever. It's absolutely interesting and unique experience that I didn't expect to have in my life. Also I lived in the little country in the middle of mountains and this was so cool. It's much cooler than being somewhere else.

# 12 November - Sunday - Yerevan - 409 day of immigration

So, the day extremely weird. Firstly the water supply didn't work in the morning and it was impossible to toilet normally. Secondly, the Deutsche bahn cancelled out train from Dortmund to Berlin and we had to look for another variants. As a result we had to book an hotel in Dortmund where we will sleep and buy another tickets to saturday. I hope that we will have time to go shopping in other case I will be without boots and it will be awful. Shitty situation. I will find a way how to avoid it but it's not so cool. Despite the all problems we were walking today in Yerevan and sad good buy to last Sunday here. We were in the part and in the city center. Also I tried to find a sim card for Germany and it's not so easy unfortunately. The cell phone companies in the EU are awful. I am comparing them to Russian ones and I see that in my homecountry everything related to networks works much better. It's fun and unusual. Also I was in bad mood in the morning it was hard to me to come back to normal condition. Only walking helped me. Tomorrow I will proceed doing all necessary things. I need to start knowledge transfer and I it's my main goal. Also I want to work a bit more on my own projects.

# 13 November - Monday - Yerevan - 410 day of immigration

I finally updated my telegram bot that helps me in learning words. It's really cool. I already started learning words using it. It's super primitive system but efficient. Besides that I was working on some DR SMILE stuff and did other things. We spent almost whole day in cafe. We were working from there. Sometimes it's cool to change the place. I am a bit tiered of my apartments but I cannot do anything with them. I just need to wait until friday. I also was talking to my colleges today about sim card in Berlin. They gave me a lot of information that I need to process. I will do it tomorrow. It's time to order something. It's weird to feel that I will live in other place soon. I am really exited and a bit scared.

# 14 November - Tuesday - Yerevan - 411 day of immigration

I got a little bit of alcohol today. I feel relaxed and nice. Also I wanted to update some soft for Ksusha on laptop, but it doesn't work. it means that I need to postpone getting rid of my internet for a day. I need to clarify this. I need fast internet connection before I fix the situation with Ksushas programs. Also the day was nice and pretty easy. I visited my Podologist and she looked on my heels. Unfortunately I still have to treat them. Some bad things are there. I am going to buy medicine in Berlin. My head is shaking because I will be out of this place on Friday. I can't believe in this. It's something absolutely crazy and new. I've been dreaming about it for many years and it is about to happen. I am happy. However I take a risk that something can go wrong and I will have some problems. So, we will see. the most important thing is to be alive. All other stuff is not so crucial

# 15 November - Wednesday - Yerevan - 412 day of immigration

I terminated a contract with Rostelecom today. Everything went fine with it. I also bought some souvenirs for my colleges. I don't know to whom I will present what, but I believe that maybe it will be cool for someone at least. My actions are more symbolic than important. Additionally I shooted another episode of my diary. Probably tomorrow I will edit it and if everything goes well publish this. I don't know yet because I don't have normal internet anymore and tomorrow I need to finish with editing before I go to some cafe with proper connection. Anyway I will probably do this tomorrow. Also I was coding today and this is cool. I don't have time last days for diving deeply to tasks. Obviously it's temporary problem. Everything will be better after moving. It's crazy that this Saturday I will be in Berlin. It's also crazy that I'm going to live in a city where I've never been before. So, the prelude of my immigration is almost finished, the real one is about to start.

# 16 November - Thursday - Yerevan - 413 day of immigration

The day was nice. Actually it's my last full day living in Yerevan. In the future I will be a guest here again. Me and Ksusha were working from Cafe today due to termination of home internet. However I finished editing a new vide in cafe. When I have a normal internet connection I will publish it. Probably I will do it tomorrow or in Dortmund. Maybe I will do it after arriving to Berlin. I don't know yet. We will see this. Also today we are going to clean the apartment. This evening the owner will come and check the place. I assume that everything is ok. I am exited about moving and a bit scared at the same time. I don't think that I am really ready. However I have to. It's my life and I believe that everything will be better. If you read these lines you can thing that I am pathetic. I don't think so. I am exited. I am really waiting for moving.

# 17 November - Friday - Yerevan - Dortmund - 414 day of immigration

So, we are here, on the German territory. Unfortunately we also experienced some problems with apartments. These people didn't send us an information abut check in. Fortunately they found the information and finally sent it. Now all good. I also extremely tiered. I am laying in a bad in hotel now and writing this lines. This day is on 3 hours longer due to time difference. In Yerevan the new day is already started. I don't have a lot of power for describing this day properly. It was long, hard day, with a lot of difficulties. Very nervous. I will go and clean my teeth and sleep after. I just need to have a rest. Ksusha already sleep.,.

# 18 November - Saturday - Dortmund - Berlin - 415 day of immigration

So, We finally arrived to Berlin. We found our apartments and everything is good for now. The problem is that this place was absolutely dirty. Ksusha cleaned this for whole evening. The main hero of this day is deutsche bahn. The train delay was 1,5 hour. It's crazy as for me. Things should not go like this. The weather here is much colder that in Yerevan. I had to unpack all warm cloths. Because of problem with train we could not visit shops and buy new shoes for me. It's crazy shit because I have only skater like VANs ones. So, tomorrow we are going to visit the city center. We will go for a walk a have nice time, I hope. Will see.

# 19 November - Sunday - Berlin - 416 day of immigration

Well, Finally I am in Berlin. Today I felt it fully. This is really great. I was so tiered yesterday that just I just could not normally do things well. Until the end working for DR SMILE I am going to align my schedule to Moscow time. It will be also convenient because I need to do a lot of things in the evening. For example, we need to buy sim cards and visit several shops including IKEA. Another crucial topic that needs to be mentioned here is that heating system doesn't work at night. It's really bad. This night was very cold. If I understood correctly something happened in this house with in. Tomorrow handyman should fix it somehow. Nights in Berlin are quite cold now. This place is much colder than Yerevan. At the same time after all shit that happened with Deutsche bahn I decided to use it as little as possible. I will flight to Yerevan via Istanbul probably. It will happen in several month so I have time to think. Also I am going to record another episode of Immigrant's diary. Yes, I decided to rename it this way and stop using Emigrant's diary. It's another chapter. I need to some rebranding.

# 20 November - Monday - Berlin - 417 day of immigration

So, this monday was nice. I finally bought shoes. We also were on Alexander platz which is quite ugly place. It was raining heavy and our passports are wet. I have doubts and concerns because of it. I am scared that I will need to change it somehow. I hope that everything will be good. But in general I was working in usual things today it was nice. My feet finally will be warmer. I like it. Tomorrow we are going to go shopping again. The day after tomorrow we will go to Rathaus where we will get alnmedung which is registration on the place. Immigrant life has been started. It's crazy.

# 21 November - Tuesday - Berlin - 418 day of immigration

The day was extremely productive. We did a lot of things. I was working on my usual things and it was nice. I updated holy theory and found a way how to improve some processes with pdf generator. After that I was working on drsmile tasks and update some other important conceptions that I have in my mind. After that we were in Ikea, additionally we tested how the local transport works. It's really expensive I would say. Really expensive. In ikea we found and bought rail for cloths and shelf to bathroom, in mediamarkt we bought small heater, and it just supermarket we bought sim cards. Now we have German numbers that is really cool. We decided to buy Lebara sim cards. I used this provider many years ago when I visited Europe for the first time and I can say that it was successful experience. I enjoyed it. I hope it will work fine this time as well. It's prepaid tariff that is more understandable for me. tomorrow we will try to contact to Germany bureaucracy for the first time. I will tell you haw it is tomorrow.

# 22 November - Wednesday - Berlin - 419 day of immigration

We were in Rathaus and sent an application for anmeldung. Everything was smooth and I am happy about it. Also I finally decided when I visit DR SMILE. I will do it tomorrow morning and I hope it will be nice and easy. Today we again were trying to find things for home. We visited Mall of Berlin and found that this place is absolutely awful and it's hard to even be there. As a result we went to Alexanderplatz to another mall. We still trying to organize our life. We did a lot for the first week and this is really amazing. I like it. THis sunday I am going to meet Ivan Gammel who is an ex CTO of DR SMILE. He is nice guy and I will be happy to see him. He invited me to a coffee in 40 minutes walking from my home. I will go there this way because it will be just cheaper and funnier for me. In general this day was nice but hard.

# 23 November - Thursday - Berlin - 420 day of immigration

So, the main thing is that I finally visited DR SMILE's office today. I've never been there before. I presented some souvenirs to people that I met there. I also got some presents from them. Actually the atmosphere there is quite sad. I saw that people are not happy about their job. It looks like Drsmile is about to be failed. Will see. I am going to watch the company in the future. Also I send an application to the Vivid band. It's a neo one that provided account for 20 euros per month. I need at least one local account in order to feel better. I also want to send some minor sum to the account because I want to buy local transport ticket. It's impossible to do without this account. Also i need to open an account for Ksusha somehow. I want her to be independent from me. It's humiliating that she has so strong connection with me.

# 24 November - Friday - Berlin - 421 day of immigration

The day was nice. I had an interview and absolutely tiered. I was working in standard things plus looked at my bot that helps me in learning German words. I cannot say that I use it on daily basis but I am going to. We will go for a walk soon. It's 15.56 o'clock. I am going to add some information here in the evening.

Unfortunately I didn't have time to add anything. IT was hard Friday.

# 25 November - Saturday - Berlin - 422 day of immigration

Well, we were in Hamburger bahnhof. It's art gallery with some contemporary art items. It was interesting but I didn't understand everything. After that we were walking in the city center and trying to find some food. In the end we did it. We found cool italian restaurant. Also we visited one shop with perfume. In general I started understand Berlin. This city looks very similar to every soviet one but much reacher. I think I like this place but I don't have some kind of honey moon. IT's because I left Russia just after beginning of the war and came back only when it was necessarily. So, I feel good. Tomorrow I will write about problems I faced to.

# 26 November - Sunday - Berlin - 432 day of immigration

Today is 432 day of my immigration. I always liked this kind of number like "432". This is a beutiful sequence of decreasing symbols. It might sounds wired but anyway. I like it. So, the main thing is that I met Ivan Gammel today who is the ex CTO in DRSMILE. He heired me some time ago and it was so interesting to meet him. We discussed a lot of topics. My new life has been started. I was happy to meet him. Maybe I will meet someone else from this company. I will see. Also we were in computer and video games museum on Karl Marx Allee. I was impressed by this small hall with some exhibits and old game machines. Later we had a dinner in japanese restaurant near Brandenburg gates. This staying in Berlin is still surreal for me. It feels like my dream came true. It's very expensive place with some problems with apartments and other bad things, but in general I am happy to be here. I came to get money and I will do it. The money, connections, business, and success are the most important things for me. I other case I could stay in Saint-Petersburg and cry because of the opportunities lack and the war in general. It's so shitty. Anyway. It's a new page that I feel in some weird way.
