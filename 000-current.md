# 01 Juli - Montag - Paris - 648 Tag der Einwanderung - Cool Rainy

Today I was working in the first part of the days and was walking alone in the second one. Alina and Ksusha went to Disnay land without me. It was cool because I really wanted to walk alone. I was on Monparnas and just walked in the city center, took photos, looked at libraries and universities. That places are very pwerful for me. I like to be there. I was alone for a whole day and was thinking a lot about my life. I am ready for recharging doing cool things again. I feel much better. I needed to have such trip. It's cool to be with money and live in Europe with local documents. Also I got an idea that Paris in what Saint-Peterburg wanted to be. It's just strange but something like this.

# 02 Juli - Dienstag - Paris - Berlin - 649 Tag der Einwanderung - Cool Rainy

Today we sad good buy to Alina in the morning and then went to Orly airport. I need to say that place is not so good as I expected. Surely it's another big international airport and so on, but the place is quite badly organized. After checkin and passing control we had to find an internal bus that moved us to real barn on the edge of airport. It was quite stupid. Also french people are not so friendly like germans usually are. Besides that they don't duplicate anouncements in egnlish. It was quite annoing. After arriving to Berlin we came home smoothly and without any problems. It was nice. We had a little rest and were ok.

# 03 Juli - Mittwoch - Berlin - 650 Tag der Einwanderung - Cool Rainy

I had to miss Toastmasters today because I didn't feel well. The flight made me so tiered. I in general don't feel so good for having all those additional activities I planned before. Howerver I try to do my best for being ok.I know that I am moaning again but it's my diary and it supposes to have such notes as well. IN general day was nice. I did my job and having rest.

# 04 Juli - Donnerstag - Berlin - 651 Tag der Einwanderung - Warm Clear sky

This morning I checked my eyes in some weird clinic. I experted to have some normal checkup but in face I just experiences some strange stuff. Surely they checked my eyes but if face they didn't offer me to have anything. I cannot get glasses or something like this. It was just waste of time and useless. Also I am conitueing to fight with XU for documents. They answer so slow and it annoys me a lot. In general I face with such behaviour every time in Germany. They are not organized at all. They have so many rules that they follow but if something happens out of them, Germans do nothing. It makes me mad. So stupid. However I need to learn their language that I did today again. Step by step I dive deeper and deepers to it. It's really cool.

# 05 Juli - Freitag - Berlin - 652 Tag der Einwanderung - Warm Clear sky

I recieved all final papers from XU and also was fucked a little by. They desided that I should not have birthday certificat because I left company. It was so stupid because at that moment I was a employee. It is unfair and speaks a lot about them. I am preparing an plan agains them that I will do definetly. Besides review on some websited I also plan contacting to ex coleeges and say some words about them. It's my intention. I will do what I need to do. It will be fair as well. Besided that nothing really interesting happened today. Life goes and I struggel with it.

# 06 Juli - Samstag - Berlin - 653 Tag der Einwanderung - Warm Clear sky

We wanted to visit a botanic garden but cancelled it due to lazyness. The good thing that I finally bought some skateboarding protection that allows me to stard using my skateboard. The probles is time. I need time for it. So, yes we were walking for a whole day and everything was really nice. It was cool calm saturday that I missed so much. It was nice.

# 07 Juli - Sonntag - Berlin - 654 Tag der Einwanderung - Warm Clear sky

It's hard to find so useless day in this uneverce. we were walking and sitting at home. Not more. I literally did nothing today. Usually it is quite rare situation but this is a fact. I did nothing.

# 08 Juli - Montag - Berlin - 655 Tag der Einwanderung - Warm Rainy

This monday is really important. I finally slpit my Holy Theory project to two parts. The first one is a piece of software for building books and another one is about wiritng a book itself. I thought about it for a really long time. The biggest consern that I had was impossibility of publishubg software and text under the same licence. In fact If I want to protect what I do I must split them and select proper licences for them. I decided to use gpl2 for soft and some other for text. I am going to change versioning approach as well. It's important thing in general. So yes. It is a new step of my projct. I am really exited to having something new. I need to pick a name for software, theoretical articles will be Holy Theory like it was planned initially. Besides that I was in the office today and did a lot of interesting things.

# 09 Juli - Dienstag - Berlin - 656 Tag der Einwanderung - Warm Rainy

I selected new name for the project, I will be called flexographer. It is a little bit long but I don't care. It's is a name for the soft, not for a product. The weather in Berling quite shitty. Rains are really heavy and try to wash everybody away. This is crazy. But it is what it is. I still don't have time to start writing a rewive to XU company. I need to plan it finally. Also I decided to stop using DUOLINGO at all. I was using it for 455 days in a row which was crazy and addicitve. I am happy to get rid of it.

# 10 Juli - Mittwoch - Berlin - 657 Tag der Einwanderung - Warm Rainy

The office day was nice and rainy a litte bit. In the evening I was on Toastmasters meeting and It was absolutely disaster. First of all I was aextremely tiered and the place where we were was extremely heat. I could not brethe almost. Crazy. Because of it I left the meeting in the middle of it and the heavy rain cought me. I was so bad that I had to move my passport to the pants pocket because my backpack literally was watered. It was crazy.

# 11 Juli - Donnerstag - Berlin - 658 Tag der Einwanderung - Warm Rainy

I was at home toaday. I like such days. Office is a good thing is some respect but destroying. Every time I struggle because of something there. However I had a nice day at home and did nothing. I like such days so much. Some cool things were delivered at home and it was also cool.

# 12 Juli - Freitag - Berlin - 659 Tag der Einwanderung - Warm Rainy

Today we were in the cinema and whatched a movide in english. I don't remember a name of it but it was a light film about Chennig tatum and how he was participating in Apllo program. It was really fun. But the funniest thing that made day was a karaoke box with 4 girls inside that were signing Руки Вверх band song. Karaoke box is a cabin, that looks like street toulet or photo box where you can close youself, pay some money and sing a song. The reall fun thing that I could not expect such stuff with such song on Uber platz in the middle of Berlin. It's crazy.

# 13 Juli - Samstag - Berlin - 660 Tag der Einwanderung - Warm Sunny

One of the main principles for me on this stage of my life is to have a good rest. Today I did nothing. It was really good. I can highly recommend it to others. I will do it again and againg in my life.

# 14 Juli - Sonnstag - Berlin - 661 Tag der Einwanderung - Warm Sunny

We finally were in Botanic garden. It is nice place but it's not so atmospheric I would say. If you ask me to rate all botanic gardens I were inside I would place Yerevan's one to the first place, Saint-Petersburg's one to the second, and the Berlin's Botanic garthe I place to third. It was nice but not so phantastic or atmospheric. Yea. But I am really glad to visit it finally. Besides that we were walking today and had a lot of calm, nice moments.

# 15 Juli - Montag - Berlin - 662 Tag der Einwanderung - Warm Sunny

One of the most important things in my life is to have a schedule. I don't put everything to this but I really thing it's crusial to have some big parts planned. I decided that tuesdays and wednesdays will be my office ones. I can change it only occasionally. Also I decide to stop using todoist. Yes, it's a cool piece of software but I don't use the full potentional of it. Payebal services are not for me. It's just my credo. I can pay for somthing only in case of unavoidable necessity. So, I moved all my deals to apple reminder. It will be enough. Also I started using apple calendar because I can accumulate all my calendart including business in one place. I really need it.

# 16 Juli - Diestag - Berlin - 663 Tag der Einwanderung - Warm Sunny

Office day was nice but annoying. I didn't sleep well and it made me soft and stupid. I aslo cannot find power for returning to sport again. I am not happy about myself. I should be changed. You can notice that I struggle with it for all my life. Unfortunatly I can't find specific motivation for doing sport on daily basis. Nothing can help me.

# 17 Juli - Mittwoch - Berlin - 664 Tag der Einwanderung - Warm Sunny

I was so tiered that just skip another Toastmasters meeting. It was bad but I could not. My office problem is still with me, I cannot focus there and cannot find power for concentration. The road is not destroying me anymore like it was in Saint-Petersburg, but the weather and my condition in general just remove all power from me. However who did say that I would be easy? I resolved all main immigrational problem but I still in some aftershock after all bullshit that happened to me. The life is not fair. It's just true.

# 18 Juli - Donnerstag - Berlin - 665 Tag der Einwanderung - Hot Sunny

My stepfather had a birthday today. Sometimes when I think about his and my mother's lifes I feel regret. They are so smart people but live in very bad conditions and don't have mental power for changing it. It's really sad. I wish them all the best but It's still very very sad. Besides that I was happy to work from home and having smooth day. I liked it so much. I need to anjust my schedule to that office visites. All my habits were shaped around fully remote work but now it changed. This is damn true.

# 19 Juli - Freitag - Berlin - 666 Tag der Einwanderung - Hot Sunny

I felt so tiered today that it is even hard to describe. I don't remember when I was so tired last time. I was working for a whole day on different interesting and not things and did my job. The temperature outside is really hot. It't not so easy to be concentrated on job due to it. However we did a small present to ourselfs this evening. We were in Thai massage salon. The main thing that it normal massage salon without happy end. It was really nice. I experienced such massage for the first time in my life. It was really nice. My back sad thank you to be. Surely It was imposible to pay by card there. It was no a surprice. I don't know if they just turned off pos terminal or payments didn't work due to huge fail on windows machines. It's not clear.

# 20 Juli - Samstag - Berlin - 667 Tag der Einwanderung - Hot Sunny

This saturday was absolutely cool as for me. Firstly I was in barbershop and now I look good. Secondly we were in Stadtbad Lichtenberg that is a historical city swimming pool that was opened in 1911 and closed in 1991 approximetely. This historical building in under recontruction now and sometimes people do exebitions there. THis pool will be closed in the end of the months, so we decided that it a good chance to check the building. I can say that it was really cool hostorical building. I hope it will be saved for future generations somehow. After visit to that place we got some burger and went to small museum in Shöneberg distict. The place was a shell gas station before and now it is a entrance to a museum and a caffee. We were not inside but drunk some coffee there. Then we decided to go for a walk and saw a huge street gay festival. I didn't know but shöneberg is a gay place here. There are a lot of gay bars, caffees, and shops. I was for the first time in such places. It was an interesting experience because in Russia you cannot see this on cities streets. It's absolutely prohibited. I am not a homophob and treat that people well, so I got some interesting experience. In the evening I jut sat at home and had a rest. Everything was really nice.

# 21 Juli - Sontag - Berlin - 668 Tag der Einwanderung - Hot Sunny

The weater was extremely hot today. It was 32 degrees but with high humidity that chnaged everything and made life harder. However the day was nice. We did't walk a lot today and mostly were at home. I dedicated a lot of time to my personal business and tasks that was nice and importnat. Also I did some other nice and cool thing like german lassons and finally proceeded with toastmasters preparations. Due to trip to Armenia I cannot prepare a speach strongly in advance and because of this I will plan in to the middle of september. It will be not so close to the day but importnat. I am going to join to the meetings remotly but not every wednesday. Until flight I will visit every toastmasters meetings including the next one that will be this wednesday. Also I decide to use more my ol computer because I find it cozier than work one. 13 inches screen seems to be better for me that 16 one. It's stragne but it is what it is. Maybe I will change my approach in the future but now this laptop I like more. Screen is not so big but enough for using the computer outside of apartments or something like this. It's completely different. Another thing that I want to add living in Germany is quite interesting experience that is different that I thought it might be. The difference is that it looks so trival and close to russian one but a little bit aside from I feel normal. It is really interesting.

# 22 Juli - Montag - Berlin - 669 Tag der Einwanderung - Warm Rainy

Thist day was nice but and I did really a lot of things. It's not so often thing last times but today I did something extraordinary. First of all I tasted my work finally. I had a good rest at night and it helped me to be ready for work. I did a lot of notes in my files, improved a lot of thigs, etc. Also I finally recieved my packages from temu with things that I wanted to obtain for some time. It's a case for documents and powerbank. My phone is not so good anymore and battery is quite tiered. If I go out for some walk and take photos the energy is going out very fast. So yes, now I am really better prepared for such situation. It's less than a month to my Armenia trip. I am going to close some bank accounts there and finally finish teeth treatment. I hope everything will be fine in this terms. So yes, the day productive and quite well done. I am glad about myself.

# 23 Juli - Dienstag - Berlin - 670 Tag der Einwanderung - Warm Rainy

I decided to apply a new approach for my deals. Now I write down everything I did during my days on my job in order ro remember what I was finished and what actually was going on. It helps me very much with selfcontrol. Besides that I was in the office today and the day was hard. I had tons of call about everything and was really tiered. I am actually still tiered. It is really hard people. I expected that it will be hard and it is.

# 24 Juli - Mittwoch - Berlin - 671 Tag der Einwanderung - Warm Sunny

Today I was in the office again. The pride month has been started in Germany and one of our colleges organized showing a show about drag queens. It was fun but a little bit too much. The thing is that I don't like it aesthetically. I grew up in different cultural and like more classic forms. I don't have anything against lgbrq+ people but I really love something different. It is what it is. However it was fun. In the evening I faced a weired situation with toastmasters. I came to a place that I thought to be a location for a meeting but I confuces addresses. The actual meeting was in a different location but the place has the same name. I was really angry because of sitation because I am so tired now and I gathered myself somehow to visit the place and so fucked up. It was sad.

# 25 Juli - Donnerstag - Berlin - 672 Tag der Einwanderung - Warm Sunny

I like to work from home. I hate office. The reason why people should be there sometimes is absolutely clear to me and I support it but I am fucking hate being in the office. I did a lot of things today. First of all I finilized step of speach preparation. It's really good. I need to find time for it but in general all is good with it. I need to adjust my schedule and reshape it to something really workable. Right now I fuck up every day with something unfortunately. It happend with both personal and work related tasks. I am very unstable in this sence.

# 26 Juli - Freitag - Berlin - 673 Tag der Einwanderung - Warm Rainy

If you are a normal person you like friday like I do. So, I overslept today. It happens very rarely with me and I was surprised. I just didn't head my alarm. However I did a lot of things and participated in all meetings. I still working on adjusting of the schedule. In the evening we were on Deadpool and Wolverin cinema. I enjoyed it very much despite the fact that some phrases were unclear to me. Yes, the movie was in original english. It was really cool. Also I am really exited of fact that I can watch some movies in Russian in Yerevan. It will be really really cool. On monday I need to ask for a vacation and then inform others that I am going to have it soon this year.

# 27 Juli - Samstag - Berlin - 674 Tag der Einwanderung - Warm Rainy

Berlin's summer is really rainy I must say. It's not what I excpected. however we were walking today a lot. Firsly we spent the morning in some pleasant routine and then ejoyed a pizza in a local cafe. After that we just sat in metro and came to Tiergarten station. There is a huge zoo that was founded in Soviet times in eastern Berlin. The place is really big and it is actually a huge park. We were walking and enjoyed the time. After coming back home I was so tiered that could not stand. I am writing these lines and go to sleep just after finishing them. 

# 28 Juli - Sontag - Berlin - 675 Tag der Einwanderung - Warm Rainy

The rain is still here. It's amazing. Well. this day was dedicated to cleaning of the apartments. We are going to Yerevan in two weeks and it would be cool to keep the home clean. I cleaned my part and helped Ksusha a little bit with her one. Also I were walking today a lot because I need to keep my legs in tonus. I was so scared by my previouse surgery that the sport is the part of my life again now. I gradually introduce it to my life again. Tomorrow morning I am going to do some excercises. It's just important for my health. Also I am not going to office tomorrow that makes me happy. I hate it.

# 29 Juli - Montag - Berlin - 676 Tag der Einwanderung - Warm Sunny

Unfortunatrly, my german teacher was not able to do leesson today. He could not because the internet connection in his Bremen's apartments was bad and he asked to cancel lessons for the next two weeks. It's sad and I don't like it, but I have to deal with it somehow. In general the day was nice, I was at home today and I really like it. I am going to the office only on Thirsday and Friday. I decided to do it because I want to count that days to August statistics due to my trip to Yerevan.

# 30 Juli - Dienstag - Berlin - 677 Tag der Einwanderung - Warm Sunny

I finally sent an email to XU CEO. It includes some critics of their HR department work. It's really low chance to be read but I did it and I am proud of myself. For the last two months I feel so bad in terms of my self-confidence. It's really strage thing. It's so bad that I decided to gradually go out of this shit. In other case I will not be able to live normally unfortunately. I set so many interesting and cool goals that I need to achieve somehow. I need to be consistent.

# 31 Juli - Mittwoch - Berlin - 678 Tag der Einwanderung - Warm Sunny

Today I finally visited toastmasters meeting. It was really nice and cool. I had fun that was really important. After returning from Yerevan I am going to visit meetups again. I want to schedule at least two ones every month. I need to comunicate to people. It will be fun and really valuable. However I need to mention bad stuff happened to me today. The main and only thing is that I feel toothache. It's very annoying. A peace of my tooth broked and my denta is in pain. It's really bad and only thing that makes me calm is a soon visit to Armenia. My doctor is there. He will remove all that shit and fix it.

# 01 August - Donerstag - Berlin - 679 Tag der Einwanderung - Warm Sunny

The day was nice despite that I had to spend time in office. I don't like it, you know. Since I was there for a whole nothing really important happened. However in the evening me and Ksusha were in Templhof where I finally stand on my skateboard. I enjoyed it very much. Of course due to my flyight to Armenia I cannot repeat it again until I come back. I will not have time for it. Additionally I started recording of my pppodcasts. It's one of the first steps towards returning of my self-confidence that I lose due to huge stress. It's nice.

# 02 August - Freitag - Berlin - 680 Tag der Einwanderung - Warm Sunny

Another office day was today. I am so tiered. I think that our HR's department has some unique tendency to hire young russian speaking women. It's so strange. After office I met Ksusha on ex-Mercedes platz that is Uber platz now. We were in a cinema and whatched "Trap" movie. It was a thriller about maniac that was trapped on a music concert. The movie was naive a little bit but well shaped. I enjoyed. I needed to what something light and enjoying. Also during of writing this lines I realized that forgot to turn 2nd of August back on this machine. It happened because I tested something today that was related to wrong date. I tested a specific case when a client and a server have diffrent dates and times.

# 03 August - Samstag - Berlin - 681 Tag der Einwanderung - Warm Sunny

I like saturdays. I like them especially when my tierdness starting destroyin me. Today was exact that case. We cleaned the apartment in the first part of the day. that was nice. I hate to do it but I had to because we are going to armenia in the end of the next week.  After that we were in the future museum where founders of that place tried to convince me that I need to save planet. I am not against it but I don't believe in everything that then push to me. This is true. After that we were at home and just enjoyed saturday.

# 04 August - Sontag - Berlin - 682 Tag der Einwanderung - Warm Sunny

It was the last sunday in this berlins summer. I will meet autumn in Yerevan. We were in chinese restaraunt today that offer bowls with soup that can assemble by your own. The problem was that they prohibited sharing of that dish between several persons. I hate this. I cannot understand what is wrong with that peoples. I paid for a dish and can to everything I want with it. You got my money, so fuck off. I don't undestand this totally. They can fuck themselvs. I am not against it. After that we were walking here and there. That episode with the bowl was the only bad thing happened today. It was sad but ok. fuck them.

# 05 August - Montag - Berlin - 683 Tag der Einwanderung - Warm Sunny

The heavy week has been started today. I need to be in the office daily because I am flying to Armenia very soon. I am not so exited about it because I don't like office work. I still believe that it's ok to go there only when it's important and a team has some mandatory meeting. It's complitely other thing. However I need to be strict with it due to my obligations. It's also very important for me. Besides that nothing really important happened today. I did a lot of things, finished to investigate somthing. I still need going back to my normal behaviour. It's not easy process.

# 06 August - Dienstag - Berlin - 684 Tag der Einwanderung - Warm Sunny

I am in the office again. I did a lot of important things but I was so tiered when come back home that I didn't do anything else. Also I had a german lesson today and I had to be in call office box. It was not so convinient and stupid in some respect. The only good thing is that the weather is great and it's cool to be outside.

# 07 August - Mittwoch - Berlin - 685 Tag der Einwanderung - Warm Sunny

I supposed to be on Mercury meeting today but I skipped it due to tierness. The weather is fine, but I am not fine =) Three days in the office are too much for me. I also need to be there two days more. Also I filally got that we are flying to Milan in friday afternoon, not evening like I thought. It was stupid =). So, I prepared a list of things that I need to take with me to Yerevan. I am ready morally and physically.

# 08 August - Dienstag - Berlin - 686 Tag der Einwanderung - Warm Sunny

Today I was in office again and it's not a surprice for you. I finilazed all things that should be done. It's good. Also I had a german lesson that went not so smoothly because of my tiereness. I need to focus on language more beacuse It looks like I waste my time instead of doing good progress. I will focus on it more in Armenia. I give you my word.

# 09 August - Fritag - Berlin - Milan - 687 Tag der Einwanderung - Heat Sunny

So, we arrived to Milan smoothly. It was really easy because it's just 1.5 hour flight. It was really fast. We even didn't select seats because it was paible option but the flyight was really fast. I sat in the beginning of aircraft, Ksusha at the end. However everything went smoothly. Milan was also ok,  from place to place was really fast and convinient. I am fine with that. The apartmnet is nice but not perfect. But I want to say that they are ok for that price and place. Usually such apartments in Italy are much worse. Tomorrow we are going to explore the city and flying to Armenie late night.

# 10 August - Samstag - Milan - Yerevan - 688 Tag der Einwanderung - Heat Sunny

Something was wrong to my stomach and I had heavy diarea for a whole night. Lucklty my condition became better in the mornig and we could go for a walk. We actually visited several places of interest like Duomo, Castle, Building with hanging gardens and so. Unfortunately I had an exedent in the middle of the day and had to take a shit just in bushed somewhere in Milan. It was really embaressing but all that cities don't have public toilets. It's real hell and I had no choise and had to do this. I am good person and very cultural but even me could not do anything in that situation. It was sad. Hovewer the day was perfect. After all that atrractions and adventures we came to the airport and flew to Yerevan. I am writing this line at 11 of August acutually because we just entered to apartments but due to absence of sleep I consider all events that happened until now as 10 of August. It's fair. So, we arrived to apartments and it was smoothly. we crossed the border without exedents as well, everything was nice. Now I am going to sleep. It's really a time.

# 11 August - Sonntag - Yerevan - 689 Tag der Einwanderung - Heat Sunny

So, yerevan is almost the same like it was a year ago. In general nothing changes, people are friendly and everything goes well. We didn't do a lot of thing today because of hard flight, but we walked a little bit for sure. I am happy to come back to Armenia. In general I don't have a lot of things to add because nothing happened.

# 12 August - Montag - Yerevan - 690 Tag der Einwanderung - Heat Sunny

The weather is crazy, it's really very very hot on outside. I was working in the first part of the day. My goal was to finish a lot of things that I did actually. I'm good with it. In the evening I was in the doctors office and she checked what is going on with me. Mariam did CT and it showed that I have to remove one of my teeth. It is impossible to save unfortunately. So, in the end of the treatment I will have to wait a little bit again. Luckily I have the next appointment for tomorrow.

# 13 August - Dienstag - Yerevan - 691 Tag der Einwanderung - Heat Sunny

The working day was absilutely usual and so. The coolest thing that I bought a extremely cheap shitty cup of coffee in the supermarket that I really like. Sometimes thing that are cheap and bad can be really tastefull and enjoyable. I talked to the doctor and we planned some things to the next week. Before that I have to remove my tooth that is not ok. I will do in on Friday. Surgeon will do it. I hope everything will be fine with me.

Today was our wedding anniversery. We spent really nice time in a restaraint that was extremely nice and cool. I as happy to be there. More important that Ksusha was happy as well.

# 14 August - Mittwoch - Yerevan - 692 Tag der Einwanderung - Heat Sunny

We were walking in the city center today and it was extremely nice and fine. I liked it very much. It's so cool when people around speak you mothertoung. It relief stres and improve the mood in general. I can definetely say that Armenia is some kind of rehub after Berlin. It's realy cool. The only problem that I have to work and live in diferrent time zones that is a little bit annoying. I start work too late and stops too late as well. It's unfixable issue. I need to change location for getting rid of the problem. So, I need to cincider this as no a problem. This is only way.

# 15 August - Donnerstag - Yerevan - 693 Tag der Einwanderung - Heat Sunny

My days are filled by job. I really wanted to get it but it's not what I really wanted. I think that in my case it's impossible to obtain something that I would like. Anyway I am tiered and need some rest. Because of this we walked today a little bit. The bad thing is that I feel a little bit under the weather. My tooth pains very very much. I am so happy that surgeon will remove it tomorrow.

# 16 August - Freitag - Yerevan - 694 Tag der Einwanderung - Heat Sunny

So, I have at one tooth less than before. It is sad but the cool part that the doctor set prostetic up and in 3-6 month I can set some artificial tooth. It will be nice. Also I had to move my barber to another week due to his vacation. I will go to him in one week.

# 17 August - Samstag - Yerevan - 695 Tag der Einwanderung - Heat Sunny

I don't feel good today but went for a walk with Ksusha. We planned to visit cinema, so I could not cancell this. Even more we were in Hard rock cafee. In general the day was nice. I alsways try to fulfill Ksushas expectations even if I am not ok. I think it is something really natual for every person that is in relations with someone.

# 18 August - Sonntag - Yerevan - 696 Tag der Einwanderung - Heat Sunny

We were walking for a whole day in Yerevan. We were on Kaskad, on main streets like Pushin or Tumanyan. In the evening we tried to visit Children's railroad and found it broken. A tree fell down and blocked railway. IF nobody removes it the children's railroaw will be another abadoned place in Yerevan. Will see but I don't expect something good.

# 19 August - Montag - Yerevan - 697 Tag der Einwanderung - Heat Sunny

Today's morning I was in Inecobank office and closed my entrepreneurship accounts. As you know I freezed my licence and don't want to keep it in the future. Since I immigrated to Germany I don't need it anymore. So, I closed it and it looks fine. I also reissued brocked euro card that stopped working some time ago. It's also very good. In the evening we stayed at home. I feel good today as well.

# 20 August - Dienstag - Yerevan - 698 Tag der Einwanderung - Heat Sunny

My doctor started preparations of my teeth today. He did something with them and then set a plastic temporary teeth for protection of my own. After preparations teeth beceme smaller and thinner. As a result evey food, drinks, or even air flow make me pain. It's strage. 

# 21 August - Mitwoch - Yerevan - 699 Tag der Einwanderung - Heat Sunny

days go and go. I feel not good still. And it's not about physical feeling but more about moral onec. I am really close to depression. I think that I did a lot of important deals this year and just burned out completely. It's hard to admit but it is true. Also Ksusha is flying to Russia soon and I will be alone in Yerevan. I hope to handle it.

# 22 August - Dienstag - Yerevan - 700 Tag der Einwanderung - Heat Sunny

The main story for today and Ineco bank fucked me. They told that I can keep my personal accounts after closing business onec but it was lie. I was almost mad to them. Usually I am much calmer person but this time something really crazy happened and made me mad. I wish them to fuck up the business and close it as soon as possible. it's so frustrating that someone can be so crazy and fucked. Anyway, I have to choise and have to handle it somehow. Fucking morons. On other hand I didn't have a lot of interesting things today. Just this and nothing more. One thing I forgot to say that I was in the movie yestarday and it was really nice. It's so cool to watch films in russian on the big screen even that translation breaks meanings very often.

# 23 August - Freitag - Yerevan - 701 Tag der Einwanderung - Heat Sunny

Ksusha is in Russia and I am alone here. Additionally, my brother had a birthday yesterday. Additonally I added seomthing to August 13 that I forgot to write that day.  I had to had a surgery today but it was moved due to absence of electricity in clinic. It was crazy situation I hated it. The operation was moved to monday. I hope to handle it nice.

# 24 August - Samstag - Yerevan - 702 Tag der Einwanderung - Heat Sunny

The day was nice I didn't have appointments and such things. so, I justed walked around and had fun. I started to think more and more about my mental conditions, basicall I need to change my approach to life. First of all I blocked and political channels that occupied my mind. People there don't do anything positive. They are absolutely incompetence dushbags that fighting to each other instead of helping people like me. I don't do politics and I want politicials doing they job well. But in fact they are just stupid morons.

# 25 August - Sontag - Yerevan - 703 Tag der Einwanderung - Heat Sunny

The same free day that I really wanted to have. I did nothing and just walked in Yerevan. I visited almost all my favorite places that I missed. It was nice. Beside that I planned my future life a little bit and how I would change my mental approach to thing. Actually it was all my day. Also I had a nice videocall with Ksusha. I love her and miss very much.

# 26 August - Montag - Yerevan - 704 Tag der Einwanderung - Heat Sunny

The surgery was really hard. Surgeon cut some pieces of my skin inside of my mouth and put them to another places. It was not so good and nice. It was hard. I don't feel good at all. In general I really don't know what to add. This is the main eveny in my life today.

# 27 August - Dienstag - Yerevan - 705 Tag der Einwanderung - Heat Sunny

I don't feel well again. It works as a catalisator and maked me more depressive than usual. First of all it is hard to sleep with that pain. The refrigirator in the studio we rentes is so loud that I hade to use ear plugs for decresing the noise, it doesn't help so much but somehow. Also I read cool book that helps me to mitigate my depression. I try really hard to get rid of my problems. Also I met my barber today. He did a great haircut and I was also happy to hear some news from his side. It seems to me that he is ok.

# 28 August - Mittwoch - Yerevan - 706 Tag der Einwanderung - Heat Sunny

I was in doctor's office in the morning he looked at sitiation and told me that I am recovering well. I want to believe in it. So, I do my best for being better. Also I did a lot of important persinal things today. I had to do it because my depression occupies me more and more. Besides that I was on monthly company update that our c level provides. The situation for the company is not good again. Also It's constant situation in the company in general and I was not surprised. I think that only companies from the US are good. EU is in the crisis. Sometimes I think that I selected wrong way. Will see.

# 29 August - Donnerstag - Yerevan - 707 Tag der Einwanderung - Heat Sunny

I was in the office doctor again. He did some procedures that were really important. Eveything goes well for now even that I am not so good in general. I am in the middle of the process but already totaly tiered. The only thing that supports me that it is a finish line for my teeth treatment. I dreamd about it and I am almost done even that it is hard.

# 30 August - Freitag - Yerevan - 708 Tag der Einwanderung - Heat Sunny

Where was I today? Sure! I was in the doctor's office. Surgery recovery goes pretty well and I am good. It makes me happy. In the evening I was talking to Ksusha. He is going back soon on the next week.  After doctor I had a german lesson that was also nice. I reached and crossed an important milestone. I moved to A2 level. Maybe I have chance to lear german pretty well and pass an exam that I need to. Will see.

# 31 August - Samstag - Yerevan - 709 Tag der Einwanderung - Heat Sunny

After short visit of my doctor I just walked here and there. It was tipical Saturday for me. I really did nothing and was happy about it. I miss Ksusha very much and need her near me constantly. It's not only because she is my wife but also due to close connetion we have. also I did german homework today and several exersices related to my mental condition.

# 01 September - Sonstag - Yerevan - 710 Tag der Einwanderung - Heat Sunny

The weather is still crazy here. I cannot say that I don't like it. It is just cool. I walked today a lot, I was in central station and visited several other cool places. Surely I don't have enough energy to do everyhing but I do my best. So it was nice sunday. I cannot complain. The inportant thing about my life that I don't have a lot of time here in Yerean and very soon flying back to Berlin. Actually it is going to happen in two weeks. My teeth preparation is not finished due to operation and surgeries. It's sad but I hope that doctor knows what he does.

It was a mistake in my time settings and I recorded 01 of september to 31 of august. I am sorry it was really mistake. Sometimes I switch my time for testing purposes and I forgot to change it back.

# 02 September - Montag - Yerevan - 711 Tag der Einwanderung - Heat Sunny

It was just filled with stuff and deals day. I was working on main tasks and almost didn't touch nothing else. I still have to manage my time very carefully. The problem is it's impossible to predict how much time doctor's appointment might take. But I try. Today I had a really nice german lesson. Ksusha is also going back to me very soon. The sad fact is that I was in doctor's office today again and will be there tomorrow as well. Due to limited time I need to visit him almost daily now.

# 03 September - Dienstag - Yerevan - 712 Tag der Einwanderung - Heat Sunny

Ksusha errived from Russia today but I was in the doctor's office for 6 hours. It was really hard. He finished teeth preparations and I got 24 hour's dose of anestesia. It was really harsh my friend. One of shots touched my nerv and I some electrisity came through be. It was absoltely new experience. However I was really happy to see Ksusha and despite to my condition I spent nice time with her. So, in terms of my teeth I am on yhe final way.

# 04 September - Mittwoch - Yerevan - 713 Tag der Einwanderung - Heat Sunny

In the morning I visited my doctor and just after that had a long and hard working day. Today I was talking to everybody from my team. It's a 1-1 day and I needed to ask everything that happens to them. I did great job. In general I have nothing to add for today. Nothing happened.

# 05 September - Donnerstag - Yerevan - 714 Tag der Einwanderung - Heat Sunny

To be honest I started missing Berlin. I need to admit that that place became home to me. It's really true even that it's hard to agree with it. My life changed so much and so radical that I sometimes cannot believe in it. Everything is absolutely different. It's so fun that I sit in Yerevan with intention to finish my teeth treatment and then I am flying back to Berlin because I rent an apartment there and have all business in that place. It's rdiculous. About this day - I had german lesson. To be honest it is really hard to be focused when your teeth are constantly in pain, but I do my best. I need to fix this.

# 06 September - Freitag - Yerevan - 715 Tag der Einwanderung - Heat Sunny

Today I was in doctor's office again because I needed to check how things are going after one of operations I had. So, everything is going well. It is really good sighn. Also I've been waiting for an answer from another doctor because it is a time for checking if my teeth model is good and I everything will be fine with me. So, yea, I've been waiting. In the evening me and Ksusha were in the cinema. It was really nice end of the day. I liked it.

# 07 September - Samstag - Yerevan - 716 Tag der Einwanderung - Heat Sunny

We were walking for a whole day. This weekend is our final one here. The next Sunday morning we are flying to Milan. So, we tried to enjoy the day as much as we could. I think we were successful in this respect. We were walking in victory part then walked in Cascad. The city center was also nice. So, food was nice, walking was nice as well. Even that I miss Berlin I will want to come back Yerevan.

# 08 September - Sonntag - Yerevan - 717 Tag der Einwanderung - Heat Sunny

The weather became less stable. The temperature is still hot but it sarted raining. The short wet season is almost here. However even rainy Yerevan is beautiful. We were walking today in children's railroad are again. It was nice and fun. In general I have a list of places in Yerevan that I really enjoy to visit. It partially equal to some ones on the internet but a little bit different. Maybe I will publish it in my telegram channel at some moment. Don't know.

# 09 September - Montag - Yerevan - 718 Tag der Einwanderung - Heat Sunny

The final stage of my teeth treatment has been started. I spent a half of the day in doctor's cabinet. Today he checked if tempates of my future teeth are good. In general they are ok. I was really glad to see that. It was hard but ok. Everything was good in general. Besides that I worked and had the german lesson. In general I am really tiered to write something here today.

# 10 September - Diestag - Yerevan - 719 Tag der Einwanderung - Heat Sunny

To be honest I was happy to spend this day just at home. Ksusha was in her doctor's office and I met her after that visit. We walked a little bit and came back to work. Everything was nice. I am a little bit nervouse about my teeth because it is less that a week before I need to come back home. I hope everything will be nice. Will see. I am not sure for now.

# 11 September - Mitwoch - Yerevan - 720 Tag der Einwanderung - Heat Sunny

The day was nice and nothing happened. it was good. I was working and did my things. Everythin was nice. In the evening we went to the city center and just walked. I try to enjoy my last days in Yerevan. I will visit it in six months again due to my last tooth that should be finished and also for having fun here. You probably noticed that I don't write anything about my other business, It's because I need to reload my life shortly but I will do it in Berlin when come back. I need to set goals and adjust life strategy. I will do it soon. When it's ready I will start writing my thought about it down.

# 12 September - Donnerstag - Yerevan - 721 Tag der Einwanderung - Heat Sunny

So, I finally got a message from my doctor. The final visit will be at Saturday just the day before my departure. These news were hard to me because I would like to have at least one day additionally. Unfortunately i will not be a case. I hope everything will be nice. Ksuhsa were in dentist's cabinet again and finished her treatment. IT was also nice. In general this day was nice even that I got some scary news. Also I had a strange call with my CTO. He asked some strange questions but it seemed to me that he wanted to know me better.

# 13 September - Freitag - Yerevan - 722 Tag der Einwanderung - Heat Sunny

I was working for a whole day with a strange feeling that I am about to leave this place again. It's true that Yerevan became a very important place to me. I spent a lot of time here and it impacted me very much. However, this place is not good for future life. Tomorrow I will be in the doctor's cabinet for a whole day and then going to airport. In fact this night is a last one here for me in this trip. We walked in the city center and it was really nice. I am happy about it.

# 14 September - Samstag - Yerevan - 723 Tag der Einwanderung - Heat Cloudy

So, I am writing these lines sitting in the airpot Zvartnotz. Next morning I will be in Milan already and next monday in Berlin. My teeth are in pain. The whole final operation was really exosting to me. I am so tiered of it. My doctor was also extremely tiered. He finished even after closing of the clinic. It was intence. Just after it I moved to apartments and packed all rest stuff. Ksusha was walking alone for a whole day and had fun. I am happy for her. I know that it's very important to spent time alone sometimes. Also she found how to buy cheap entrance to business lounges. Actually in russia some banks have special offerst to clients that allow them to visit such launges and invite unlimit number of friends. As a result that people started selling this free entrance on a black market. Ksusha tried to buy such access ones and it worked. So, we did it also for Yerevan's airport. I also can add that the lounge here became worse than it was before the war. The hall and all area was renovated in a bad way. However it much better than sitting in common hall with one expencive cafe.

# 15 September - Sontag - Milan - 724 Tag der Einwanderung - Heat Cloudy

This morning we arrived to Milan and moved to an apartments. Accedetally we rented the apartments without an internet connection that was not good but ok. The owner of the place was a very seniour person and he met us quite polite and well. In general we didn't have enough time for the investigation of the city today. It was because of that late flight. It was not easy as usual and we just had a rest. However in evening we were walking around the city center and tried some local things. We watched the beautiful Milan's university building. It was nice. Unfortunately we didn't have time to look at that brutal church but still. In the evening we just had a rest and did nothing really important. I liked the day. Tomorrow we are going back Berlin. 

# 28 Июня - Суббота - Берлин - 1010 День эмиграции - Жарко Облачно

Здравствуй дорогой друг. Сегодня я решил возобновить вести свой дневник, к которому не притрагивался последние 286 дней. Так получилось что я находился в сильнейшем эмоцианальном кризисе и просто забросил это дело. В какой-то момент мне стало совершенно не важна запись идей и мыслей из моей жизни. Все просто стало неинтересно и тяжело. Я прошел через жесточайший кризис прошлой осеньюю и зимой. Из-за этого у меня не было никаких сил что-то записывать. Мне немного жаль что так получилось, потому что хотелось бы записать все что со мной происходило. Это было бы полезно. Ка бы там оно не было, я решил вернуться к практике ведения дневников. Ты можешь обратить внимание что я решил вернуться к русскому языку. Это не просто так. За последние годы неплохо натренировался писать на английском и при этом уперся в какой-то максимум. Дело в том что на иностранном языке невозможно выразить все что я чувствую. Есть правда и другой момент. Возможно в будущем я буду смешивать подход и иногда писать тебе на английском или немецком языках. Я активно учу немецкий и хотел бы иногда практиковаться в сободной форме. Я немнго рассказал тебе что со мной происходило и сейчас я был бы рад просто рассказать о сегодняшнем дне. Сегодня я и Ксюша просто провели обычный выходной. Мы пообедали в прекрасном заведении под названием Lion Burger и после поехали погулять в парк Garten der Welt. Как и многое в Европе этот парк платный. Стоимость 9 евро. но мы еще купили билет на канатную дорогу, которая стоила 3.50 примерно. Вообще это было круто прокатиться на канатной дороге. После этого прогулялись по самому парку и вернулись домой. Сам парк находится в районе Марцан, который достаточно печально известей каким-то неуемным количество иммигрантов. Я там побывал во второй раз и не ощутил этого. Скорее всего нужно было сходить в специфическую часть. В целом день был хороший. В следующий раз я поделюсь чем-то что я не записывал в течении этих 286 дней. Как разогрев - меня сократили в январе.

# 29 Июня - Воскресение - Берлин - 1011 День эмиграции - Жарко Облачно

Погода в Берлине очень жаркая. Температура настолько мучительна, что начинаешь подвывать. Но при этом есть оущещние что уехал в отпуск. Очень классное. В нашей квартире окна в пол и выходят на балкон. Две секции открываются как огромные двери. Если их открыть то квартира превращается в полноценное отпускное жилье, что ощущается очень необычно и круто. Я обещал тебе немного начать раскрывать что произошло со мной за время пока я не вел этот дневник. одно их важных событий было то что я прошел испытательный срок в компании Visable Labs где работал. Это прозошло в прошлом ноябре. Это был невероятно нервный момент для меня так как до самого конца не было ясно получится ли что-то или нет. В результате получилось. Также я был в курсе того что готовятся сокращения. У меня была иллюзия что меня это не затронет, но в январе меня попросили покинуть копанию. Я попал в ситуацию где мне пришлось срочно искать работу. Этим я и занимался какое-то время. Это было по настоящему тяжело. В следющий раз я расскажу еще немного. Я бы хотел сохратить эти дневниковые записи в небольшом размере. Завтра утром я иду в спортзал а после начнется работа. Как ты понял я работу все же нашел. Но об этом в дргие разы. Сегодня мы ездили на Гезундбрюннен и ели немного в макдональдсе. Затем прогулялись и вернулсь домой. Ну и плюс мы наконец-то доубирали квартиру. 

# 30 Июня - Понедельник - Берлин - 1012 День эмиграции - Жарко

Погода сегодня, конечно, очень жаркая снова. В целом день прошел неплохо за исключением того что пришлось раньше уйти с тренировки из-за того что разболелась спина. В моем возрасте лучше с этим не шутить. Я как обычно неплохо разогрелся перед упражнениями, но что-то пошло не так. Грустно конечно. Урок немецкого языка прошел тоже хорошо. Я приближаюсь к сдаче экзамена, осталось совсем немного. Это будет нервный опыт, но мне надо через него пройти. Другого выхода нет. Я очень хочу получить сертификат b1 чтобы показать что я способен хотя бы на что-то. Если получится, то я вообще докажу себе что могу за полтора года выучить язык на достаточном уровне чтобы его сдать. Как-то так. Я тебе не рассказывал, но пару недель назад я сдавал экзамен на бюргера. Это был тест в котором я должен был ответить на некоторые вопросы связанные с жизнь в Германии. я думаю что прошео его хорошо, но результаты по его поводу надо всегда ждать очень долго, к сожалению. Посмотрим что будет, экзамен был рельно очень простым. Завтра буду работать из офиса, вообще я должен ездить туда два раза в неделю, это обязательно посещение. В целом мне это нравится, так что в ок. Наверно дело просто в том что мне нравится атмосфера в коллективе. Пару фактов хочу рассказать о том где я был в последнее время. Важный момент что я встретил новый год в Италии, во Флоренции. Затем я был еще в Португалии и додлал зубы в Ереване. Я кругом молодец.

# 01 Июля - Вторник - Берлин - 1013 День эмиграции - Жарко

Сегодня работал из офиса. Моя новая компания достаточно комфортное место для времяпрепровождения. Гораздо лучше и уютней чем предыдущее. Это по настоящему меня удивляет. Сейчас я работаю в страховой компании, что само по себе очень необычно и крайне интересно. Я очень рад начать получать опыт именно в этой части. Мне всегда было интересно просочится в банковскую или страховую компанию. Погода в Берлине очень жаркая, сегодня еще терпимо, а завтра обещают вообще кошмар. Когда возвращался домой был какой-то инцидент на S-Bahn и из-за этого мне пришлось высаживаться на станции Gesundbrunnen и уже оттуда ехать на U-Bahn домой. Не могу сказать что это было радостно. Потерял в районе 30 минут. Но в целом все окей. Сегодня я еще выдам небольшой кусочек событий который произошел со мной. Когда меня уволили из предыдущей компании я столкнулся в немецкой стразовкой. Мне очень помогла одна юридическая компания. Они смогли достаточно умело провернуть весь процесс и я выйграл деньги. Это было невероятно круто и полезно. Я рад что имею такого типа страхование, это очень помогает в жизни. Я выйгла почти в 3 раза больше отступных чем мне было предложено изначально, что очень неплохо.

# 02 Июля - Среда - Берлин - 1014 День эмиграции - Жарко

Сегодня по настоящему жарко. На улице +36, что для Германии редкое явление. Местные в шоке. Я работал сегодня из офиса и как следствие сидел в комнате с кондиционером. Плюс у меня было несколько митингов, но и там дышалось более-менее неплохо. Сегодня я уваствовал в нескольких крайне познавательных беседах, что меня очень даже порадовало. Каждый раз эти беседы проходят тяжело, но я воспринимаю такие встечи/митинги как что-то необходимое для собственного роста. Так что хоть и хочется поныть, но в этом нет никакого смысла. Это полезное являение. Иногда мне кажется что я не на своем месте, так как сдесь у меня гораздо больше отвественности чем я ожидал. мне думалось что я буду участвовать только в жизни своей команды, но оказлось что вообще не так. Я участвую вообще в жизни тех отдела на очень разных стадиях, что меня очень даже радует. Это сильно лучше чем я ожидал. Хотя, повторюсь, это не так уж и просто. Завтра я работаю из дома, что тоже очень неплохо. Нужно встать вовремя чтобы сходить в спорт зал до того как придет чертова жара.

# 13 Июля - Воскресение - Берлин - 1025 День эмиграции - Дождливо

Получился очередной пробел в ведении дневника. Это грустно конечно, но не страшно, У меня больше не стоит цели вести его каждый божий день. Может быть я к этому и вернусь но на данный момент это так как есть. Я стал испытывать снова некоторую неудовлетворенность жизнью. Базируется она снова на моем непонимании что делать дальше. Как будно некоторые промежуточные цели почти достигнуты, и мне надо придумать что делать дальше. Это странный период. Он не очень приятный, но, к сожалению, уже совсем не новый и встречающийся часто. Слишком частые смены работы меня выбивают из колеи, и у меня есть надежда не увидеть подобной проблемы снова. Посмотри. Я делаю все от себя зависищае для того чтоы пройти испытательный срок. Вообще у меня есть абсолютно мудацкое ощущение что я нахожусь на испытательной сроке последние 2 минимум. Это очень неприятно. С другой стороны никто меня не заставлял переезжать именно в Германию. Я мог выбрать и какие-то другие опции. Но так что есть, то есть. Может быть когда-то все будет иначе. В следующем месяце я и Ксюша едем в Россию. Я там не был 2 года уже. Будет волнительный опыт скорее всего. И конечно-же сильно грустный в некотором отношении.

# 03 Августа - Воскресение - Берлин - 1038 День эмиграции - Дождливо

Как в можете заметить я не каждый день делаю заметки в этот дневник. Это не очень хорошо. Какой-то масштаб в моей жизни постепенно ушел. Я настолько загружен проблемами что не могу просто взять себя в руки и действовать как мне надо. Слишком часто я чувствую себя несколько уничтоженным. Для борьбы с ощущением собственной бесполезности и беспомощности я решил записывать в чем я молодец. Желательно делать это каждый день, но по факту - как получится. Например сегодня я поработал над проектом который я уже очень давно держу в голове. Если вы почитаете мой дневник, то можете обратить внимание что достаточно часто я начинаю делать какие-то проекты. Это обычно происходит когда у меня есть на это время и я не перегружен какими-то жизненными обстоятельствами. Перед тем как описывать какой я был сегодня молодец, я бы хотел просто описать что произошло недавно. 

мне пришли результаты на Einbürgerungstest - специальный тест на натурализацию. Я набрал 33 балла из 33, что делаем меня супербюргегом. Помимо этого, у меня прошел экзамен по немецкому языку. Я надеюсь что всю теоретическую часть я сдал успешно. Не уверен насчет разговора. Мне было невероятно тяжело на той части. Может быть все было ок, но сказать сложно. Посмотрим. Жду результатов. Теперь хочу перейти к штукам, которые я сделал хорошо:

**Сделал хорошо**

1. Поработал наконец-то на проектом преобразования речи в текст с последующим его форматированием. Пока он работает только локально. Если это все дело будет работать хорошо, то я попробую подключить платные провайдеры. Посмотрим, все очень зависит от ситуации. НО это в чем я сегодня молодец.

2. Сделал уборку в душе, что было очень важно сделать, так как через неделю мы едем в Россию, и у меня просто не будет возможности это сделать. Конечно до пятницы дшевая кабина снова зарастет кальцием, но что поделать.

# 11 Августа - Понедельник - Санкт-Петербург - 1046 День эмиграции - По петербургски

Приехал в Петербург позавчера ночью. Пересечение границы было не очень гладких из-за большого количества народа и длительного ожидаения. В сумме мы потратили в районе 8 часов на пересечении границы. Это было по настоящему не легко. Из-за наладок рейс, который мы купили улетел, и нам пришлось покупать другие билеты. К счастью деньги и все такое были и мы с этим справились.

# 5 Октября - Воскрсение - Берлин - 1046 День эмиграции - Холодно

Мне хотелось бы рассказать что все хорошо, но это не совсем правда. 10 дней назад мне сказали что я не прошел исптытательный срок, и я опять ушел в круговорот поиска работы. К сожаленю это иногда происходит. Чтобы восстановить свое ментальное состояние я решил вернуться к практикам, которые позволили мне относительно достойно пережить начало войны. Последний год прошел для меня как будто в тумане, я практически не помню что было достигнуто что-то хорошее. Чтобы исправить то, и вспомнить, я решил вернуться к ведению дневника. В прошлый раз это особенно не получилось, посмотрим как это пройдет сейчас. Я снова начал активно готовиться к прохождению интервью. Конечно это не будет так просто, как и всегда, но я надеюсь на свой ум и стойкость. Вообще, самое обидно во всем произошедшем, что моя подача на постоянное место жительства откладывается на неопределенный срок. Это меня очень расстраивает.

# 12 Октября - Воскресение - Берлин - 1046 День эмиграции - Холодно и дождливо
 
  Сегодня я попробовал быть в максимальном спокойствии. Утром я попросил чат сгенерировать план для СДВГшника, с чем он превосходно справился. У меня есть огромная проблема - удерживать внимание и концентрацию длительное количество времени. Хоть это ни не диагностировано, но я думаю что у меня это СДВГ. Вся штука в том что мне обычно помогают протоколы поведения для людей с такими проблемами. Сегодня я его использовал и сделал действительно много разного и полездного. Так как я снова лишился работы, то, конечно, основной фокус внимания это подготовка. Сегодня я попросил чат потестировал меня не различные темы связаные с моей специальностью, чем я с удовольствием позанимался. Мне кажется что это один из самых эффективных способов борьбы с собой сейчас.
