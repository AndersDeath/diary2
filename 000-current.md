# 01 August - Tuesday - Yerevan - 306 day of immigration

So, Today I had lot of call about everything. DR SMILE hired a freelancer that should help me with implementation of the new patient portals. THis is a KPI for my team. I also a call with some potential employer. It's General Electric. I don't expect anything from them. The situation is that I still work on my portfolio. I do it really hard. I need to finish 3 project in 3 weeks. It's quite challenging process. However I believe in myself. Everything will be good. I think you also see how my mood changes after Ksusha returned. Depression went out. The mood is much better but I am also very tiered.

The weather today is crazy. It's 22:47 o'clock and 27 degree Celsius outside. It's heavy. I had a tech interview with one company today. I don't expect anything from them. I barely could think. At the same time I will have another call with autohaus company. It's weird place for work but still. I also need to start doing something with my mental condition. Surely after Ksushas return I feel my better, however I am not so stable. There are many reasons, including necessity of preparations for immigrations, current tasks in DR SMILE and many other things. I try to do my best.

# 03 August - Thursday - Yerevan - 308 day of immigration

The heat is killing me. the weather is still extreme. I still working on my portfolio. I updated the main page of the project. I started getting fat. It's something new because I kept my body relatively fit. Things changed. Tomorrow I am going to clinic to my dentist. He should extract 3 tooth and screw one new prothesis. I hope that it will be latest procedure this kind to me in Yerevan. I am really going to leave this country at the end of the year. Probably it will be Germany. you know that I prepare documents for freelance vise and have interview with new potential jobs. It's funny that the majority of the are from Munich but I want to be in Berlin. Germany is a great place for preparations before moving to the US. Finally I want to settle there. We want to it actually.

# 04 August - Friday - Yerevan - 309 day of immigration

I got surgery today. It wasn't so cool. Surgeon installed one prosthetic and removed some bads with shit. Also I got perforation between mouth and nose areas. My nose started bleeding after surgery. It was something absolutely new for me. I never experienced this shot before. I feel relatively ok now. Pain is not so heavy. At the same time I need to do specific procedures. The first part of the day was dedicated to programming. I tried to do all tasks that are in dept on me. Finally I did it and now all is good. I also was invited to the final interview with company tracify. It's cool. I didn't expect that. Even if their conditions will be not good I happy to be on the final step. Also I gather documents for freelance visa. this is still my main option. I am not sure about working visa and such. Maybe everything will be good. The mood is better that before. It's good. I feel some fewer and it's obviously because of today's procedures.

# 05 August - Saturday - Yerevan - 310 day of immigration

I feel good today. The don't feel any bad stuff after surgery. Yesterday it was hard. Nevermind. We were in Gurmenia today again. The crousanne, I don't know how to write down this word, was nice. I also checked my eyes and tomorrow I will get new glasses. My current ones are nice, but a bit old. Tomorrow Ksushas newie and Sister Julia will come to us. They want to spend a nice days here in Yerevan. We will support them but will not be babysitters. The weather is extremely hot here. I handled it better today that usually buy still. I also try to find some stamina for working on portfolio. It's not so easy. However I try to do my best. Despite the result that will be with my immigration I need to prepare some real cases of my work. At the same time I do investigation how to write great layouts. I need to be more focused on really front-end part that on programming in general. this is my area of expertise. I need to remember about it. Being in focus is crustal. I cannot afford spreading my attention to not related topics anymore. Surely I need to grow as programmer and manager. Especially as manager. Front-end and management should be my way to wealthy life.
