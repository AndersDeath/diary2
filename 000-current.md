# 01 August - Tuesday - Yerevan - 306 day of immigration

So, Today I had lot of call about everything. DR SMILE hired a freelancer that should help me with implementation of the new patient portals. THis is a KPI for my team. I also a call with some potential employer. It's General Electric. I don't expect anything from them. The situation is that I still work on my portfolio. I do it really hard. I need to finish 3 project in 3 weeks. It's quite challenging process. However I believe in myself. Everything will be good. I think you also see how my mood changes after Ksusha returned. Depression went out. The mood is much better but I am also very tiered.

The weather today is crazy. It's 22:47 o'clock and 27 degree Celsius outside. It's heavy. I had a tech interview with one company today. I don't expect anything from them. I barely could think. At the same time I will have another call with autohaus company. It's weird place for work but still. I also need to start doing something with my mental condition. Surely after Ksushas return I feel my better, however I am not so stable. There are many reasons, including necessity of preparations for immigrations, current tasks in DR SMILE and many other things. I try to do my best.

The heat is killing me. the weather is still extreme. I still working on my portfolio. I updated the main page of the project. I started getting fat. It's something new because I kept my body relatively fit. Things changed. Tomorrow I am going to clinic to my dentist. He should extract 3 tooth and screw one new prothesis. I hope that it will be latest procedure this kind to me in Yerevan. I am really going to leave this country at the end of the year. Probably it will be Germany. you know that I prepare documents for freelance vise and have interview with new potential jobs. It's funny that the majority of the are from Munich but I want to be in Berlin. Germany is a great place for preparations before moving to the US. Finally I want to settle there. We want to it actually.

I got surgery today. It wasn't so cool. Surgeon installed one prosthetic and removed some bads with shit. Also I got perforation between mouth and nose areas. My nose started bleeding after surgery. It was something absolutely new for me. I never experienced this shot before. I feel relatively ok now.
