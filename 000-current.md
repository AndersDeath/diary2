# 01 February - Wednesday - Yerevan - 125 day of immigration

Today I recorded a video. When I have time I will edit it and publish. It will be another episode of Immigration Diary. I met a lawyer that will help me with documents. I trained computer science. I don't remember maybe I mentioned it before, I decided to switch my focus to engineering things.
