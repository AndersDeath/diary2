# 01 December - Friday - Berlin - 437 day of immigration

Today I visit the XU office and met all people there. It was nice conversation and onboarding in general. I enjoyed it a lot. It was filly office day but with some cool things. They gave me a working laptop, which is very nice and also they gave me some souvenirs like branded bottle, book, and other things. Additionally they gave me wireless keyboard and mouse control which I will not use probably because it's not so useful. But anyway I took it because I don't refuse anything if people give me something valuable. Also drsmile offboarding is absolutely weird. They didn't send me an email or some list of things that I need to do - nothing. It's very weird. I hope they are ok with it because HR's know about my quitting. Also I sad good buy to my bonus because they just didn't sign any paper and I suppose that they will fuck me. Maybe not, but I will know about it in three of four months probably. The weather in Berlin is very cold which is not good but understandable. Locals are in panic because it's rare -6 degrees. Also I will start to clear my laptop tomorrow. I need to remove a lot of things from the place.
