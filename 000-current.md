# 01 Februar - Donnerstag - Berlin - 499 Tag der Einwanderung

Уникальный момент. Я обычно не пишу дневник на русском, но сегодня решил воспользоваться великим и могучим. Вообще у меня есть мысль снова перейти на русский язык в ведении дневка. По большей части я хочу это сделать для того чтобы иметь возмодность лучше раскрыть свои мысли. Ну и объем увеличится кратно. Итак, сегодня я был в офисе. Я провер ретроспективу для своих коллег и кажется им понравилось. Также я ходил со своим начальником прогуляться по району и болтал о разном. В первый раз такое было. Помимо этого есть высокая вероятность что я поеду в Манхайм на следующей неделе. Дело в том, что меня пригласили на онсайт интервью. Я думаю что это хорошая возможность размяться и вообще посмотреть что там происходит в проекте. Это небольшой стартап, который планирует начать производство и мне это интересно. Вообще, тут огромное количество стартапов и я хочу участвовать в них, это может мне позволить неплохо развиться в финансовом и не только план. Логичто что я хочу развиваться и зарабатывать. Для этого я приехал сюда. Вообще настроение неплохое, рабочие забрали поломанную стиральную машину и мы скоро закажем новую. Спалось на новой квартире хорошо. До сих пор не вериться что это мой новый дом. Есть что-то странное в том что я живу теперь в Берлине.

Anyways. let's go back to things that happened today. so I was working as usual and everything was nice. The main goal for today was to change registration here. we wnt to Pankow burgeramt and was surpeised by absend of signature in the confirmation that we live in this apartments. It's so crazy that I cannot balieve in it. It's so shitty shit. Unfortunately we found it in the clerk's cabinet. It's so shitty. Luckily Ksusha obtained a termin for the next teusday. I am happy about it. I will call to the landlord and ask to sign the document. This is very important because we have eveything for getting residency. it's also extremely important. After getting documents we can tavel out and inside the Europe with no problem.

To be honest processes in XU are set up awefully. I had to rewrite a lot of things that I did for the last several weeks. It's strange. I would be hapy to change my job. I need to really work here but I don't want to do it. I really want to work as CTO. Anyways I am going to this direction. The another significant thing happened - workers from Telecom came to us and set up something. It means that on the end of the next week we will have an internet connection. It's very cool. Besides that I called to landlord and they prepared proper paper for Burgeramt. It's so cool that on the next week we will make almedung. It's really nice and cool. Additionally I feel so strange because I satred gaining weight. It happens because of stress I eat much more that usual. I need to control it again. I thing that I will buy something for running. I really like to do it and I need to do it. Since we are here for a long period of time I can afford equipment for it.

The valentine day went well. The Spanish/Portugeese restaraunt that I found on TripAdviser was really nice. I enjoyed food very much. Besides that I had a talk with my manager - Paul.

It's very important for now. Surely I need to find another cool place for work, but now I need money for paying bills and just living. Addtionally I need to pay more attention
