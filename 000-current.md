# 01 October - Sunday - Saint-Petersburg - 367 day of immigration

I met Mom and aunt Anya today. I was happy to see them. I met mother in the city center on Nevsky prospect after that I visited Anya on Chkalovskaya. She lives on Kupchinskaya street. It was meeting. I enjoyed it. After that I met Ksusha and we went to Sevkabel port. It's a cultural place on Vasilyevskiy ostrov. In general the day was nice. We finished preparation of documents. Tomorrow we will go to the visa center and at 3pm we will sit to Spsan and go to Tver. There we will met Igor and he will drive us to Rzhev. After one day there we are going to Moscow and back to Yerevan. The only concern is how I will cross the border. It's not so clear. I hope that there will be no problems. Will see. Now I am sitting in Nastya's studio and waiting for Ksusha. oh, We also were in Balagan food court. It's a nice place on Chkalovskaya with a lot of nice mini-restaurants. I was there before and I was happy to visit that place again. So, also I need to take a shower and go to sleep. I am quite tiered and would be happy to have a rest. Good day.

# 02 October - Monday - Saint-Petersburg - Rzhev - 368 day of immigration

So, My application is in visa center. We spent 2.5 hours there. It was really crazy. One hour was burned for checking my document pocket and another 40 minutes for getting fingerprints. Other minutes were burned for waiting, payments and waiting, waiting, waiting... It was hard. However we finished with it and after that we packed our luggage and arrived to Tver on Sapsan. Igor - Ksusha's mother husband met us there and drove to Rzhev. Oh, I forgot we met my mom in metro in te morning. It was just for a couple of minutes but very pleasant. I miss my mom and for others. The full tomorrow we will be here but the day after tomorrow we are going to Moscow and fly back to Yerevan. I am still worried about crossing the border. I hope everything will be ok. In general the was good. The only bad thing is that Ksusha is sick and feels bad. Maybe she will be better tomorrow.

# 03 October - Tuesday - Rzhev - 369 day of immigration

Today I was working on my portfolio a lot. The scope from DS is still unclear. I just ignore a lot of things there. Maybe today someone can give me a direction for work. I don't care anymore. Fuck them. Also ME and Ksusha were in Arabica cafe which is in the city center of Rzhev. It's nice place with average food but with great coffee. It's one of the best cafes I even been. After that we visited Ksusha's grandmother. She is 80 years old but looks good despite the cancer disease . She is in remission now. I hope everything will be ok with her. Another thing is that I got sick. I think I just got it from Ksusha because she did't feel good since we left Yerevan. She is much better now but I have all this symptoms. I hope to be ok because tomorrow we are going to Moscow and I need to recover a bit. Nevermind. I think everything will be good.

# 04 October - Wednesday - Rzhev - Moscow - 370 day of immigration

So, I am writing these lines sitting on chair in Rzhev. In 30 minutes we are going to bus and then will have a long drive to Moscow. I suppose it will be for about 4 hours including traffic. It's impossible to avoid this problem sadly. We will sleep at hotel in Domodedovo airport and tomorrow's morning flying to Yerevan. I hope that it will not be a problem with crossing the border. I sill have a hope. At the same time our document are already in German embassy in Moscow. If everything is good we will get an answer soon. After that we need a wait a bit for Ksusha's visa and then we are ready to go. I still think a lot about Germany. As I mentioned before It will be another step in our lives. I don't know how Ksusha will adapt her deals and business there but I am sure that I will help her. At the same time I got funny story from my our owners of apartments. I will copy the story from watsup soon. It's really interesting.

# 05 October - Thursday - Moscow - Yerevan- 371 day of immigration

I woke in Maxima hotel at Domodedovo airport. It's quite nice place for waiting for a flight when you don't want to pay a lot of money withing Moscow. I crossed both Russian and Armenian borders very well. I didn't have any problems. However an officer on Armenian border had doubts about Ksushas passport. The problem is that some of them don't know that Russian could have two foreign passports. It's not a new practice but it's still rare situation. I made two passports in order to be able to send of one to an embassy and travel using second one. Luckily it was not a problem and she crossed the border as well. After that we reached home and ordered sushi. After that I went to supermarket and bought goods for breakfast. I really feel like I came home. It's nice. I missed Saint-Petersburg very much but now I realized that don't live there anymore. Surely it's painful. 

Also I need to add couple of sentences about yesterday's road from Moscow to Rzhev.
