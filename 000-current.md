# 01 April - Montag - Berlin - 559 Tag der Einwanderung - Cold Sunny

I hate day of fool. It's always a piece of shit. However nobody pranked me and I am happy about it. At the same time I did a lot of cool things during the day. I learned some stuff and released another version of Holy Theory. On bad thing happened to me. It looks like my haemorrhoids came back to me. I need to have some relief but I don't know how. The situation is dangerous again.

# 02 April - Dienstag - Berlin - 560 Tag der Einwanderung - Cold Sunny

The same weather like yesterday. I feel worse today. We even got a couple of new termins to doctors. I hope to visit them on the next week. I hope to see them really. It looks like I am very close to surgery again. WIll see. I try to get some specific pills that can help me. I need to be on diet now that is sad but important to me. Besides that I did a lot of good things again. I was coding and did some investigation things. To be honest my illness pushed my mood down again. It's painful really. At the same time I still have an illusion that medications will help me.

# 03 April - Mittwoch - Berlin - 561 Tag der Einwanderung - Cold Sunny

The day was nice. Nothing fency happened. I still don't feel good. However I did a lot of good things and it's really cool. The day after tomorrow I will go to a doctor and get something him. I hope that my insurance will cover the visit. I really hope. I don't have money for this now. I think everything will be ok. I also have a termin to proctologist and it's good.

# 04 April - Dienstag - Berlin - 562 Tag der Einwanderung - Cold Sunny

Today I also feel ok. Surely I cannot postpone the visit to doctor. It's cool that I am going to him tomorrow morning. I found all papers I received last time when I had surgery. I am sure that It will help me tomorrow. I also need to be in schedule again. I am not so motivated to work in XU. The stopping working with the Polish team hit me very much. I could not expect this. Currently I need to change my behavior's strategy. Besides that I just was in the bed for a hole day. I could do much due to pain. I drink pills and other medication but for me even sitting is uncomfortable now. I hate this illness. Vein system is my weak point. After treatment that I suppose to get tomorrow I will do much more sport. I really don't want to have this again. It's so bad.

# 05 April - Freitag - Berlin - 563 Tag der Einwanderung - Warm Cloudy

I was in the doctor office today. He gave me a paper for proctologist quite easy and quickly. Here in Germany it's impossible going to such doctors without approval from a therapist. So yea. I got everything nad it's nice. The bad think that a termin to tsurgeon is in 10 day. I need to wait for it and eat medications. It's sad because I don't want to destroy my liver and kidneys. But I have no choise. Additionally I was in Barbershop and a woman did haircut fom me. I think that I didn't do haircut by barber-woman for the last 5 years I believe. This barberin did hair very well. Tomorrow we are going to meet Gammel family that is really cool. So, in general the day was nice.

# 06 April - Samstag - Berlin - 564 Tag der Einwanderung - Warm Sunny

The day ws nice. We were in Garder of the World in Eastern Berlin. We walked there with Gammel family and they showed us this place. It's a really cool garden with themed to different cultures corners. We were walking, talking, having fun. After that we ate in Ikea and visited Uniqlo because I needed to buy some stuff there. Also I payed for CT finally and exchanged 300 dollars we had as a reserve. It's was nice. We were so tired that the only thing we could do at home - sleep. In genera the day was really nice. I enjoyed it very much. I would like to repeat this.

# 07 April - Sontag - Berlin - 565 Tag der Einwanderung - Warm Sunny

Today we finally cleaned up our aoartments and did some other typicall activities. The summer came to Berlin, the weather is so cool. We had a lunch on outside table in one of local restaraunts. It's was really nice. Warm Berlin is really cool and enjoyable. I like it very very much. Surely the fact that we came to the place in the middle of the Winter played its bad role. We wasn't happy of the place, but now everything feels much better. Another thing is that I had a German lesson this morning. It sucks that I need to memorize a lot of things. I don't like it at all, but I need to have b1 certificate for getting permanent residency. It's my real plan that I need to accomplish somehow. I will do my best for it.

# 08 April - Montag - Berlin - 566 Tag der Einwanderung - Warm Sunny

The summer has come. The weather is awesome. Being on the street is even better than in the room. This really helps to be in normal conditions. I feel normal, my hemorrhoids doesn't pain. It's good. In one week I will visit a doctor that is really cool and I am waiting for it really hard. I expect some surgery after this visit, but I cannot say when it might happen. I hope that it will be not so annoying and painful. However, I will see. Besides that I released another holy theory bunch and so on. Additionally I had an interview with one company, it was mostly cultural fit talk. I have a hope to be invited to the next step. This company has 6 interviews but if it is good I will get really nice position. For keeping myself in normal mental state I just don't think about it and try to be ready to everything but don't press my mentality. I really don't want to be crazy.

# 09 April - Dienstag - Berlin - 567 Tag der Einwanderung - Warm Sunny

The weather was so cool that I could sit on balcony and work. In general I was coding for a whole day. I finished with some things that I could concentrate my efforts. Now everything is nice. TOmorrow I am going to the office. THey asked me to do it because some potential investors are going to visit us. I am curious about it. Overall my mood is better again. I cannot say that I am absolutely ok, but anyway. Also today happened interesting thing. I was talking to a recruiter that rejected my application to some position but offered me other one that was a company that already rejected me. Sadly but it was true. At the same time this is the first such case in my life. It's funny.

# 10 April - Mittwoch - Berlin - 568 Tag der Einwanderung - Warm Sunny

I spent the whole day in the office that was nice but a little bit painful due to my illness. However I did a lot of things again. I had a call with some guy from linkedin where he asked me some questions about immigration difficulties. So, it was interesting because it was not about job. I also had an interesting talk with Paul about product manageress behavior. They don't want to listen to us for some reasons, I don't know why but it's a big problem int the company. I try to not press myself so much and just ignore this. In the evening me and Ksusha tried to visit toastmasters club but their address on the official web site was wrong and we came to the old one. I was sad about it and it was so annoying. It is another moment in Germany that I hate. It's so German to change the address and don't replace the old one on the official website.

# 11 April - Donnerstag - Berlin - 567 Tag der Einwanderung - Warm Sunny

The day was nice. I was working on fixing interesting bug in XU company. It consumed almost all my day. Additionally I tried to do a checking of a car that I am going to rest on Sunday. It was unsuccessful and I don't know why. Maybe it doesn't work with russian drive license. I will get it on Sunday in airport. Also I had a german lesson and some other minor things that are not so interesting in this context. Another thing that I started loosing my patients about DR SMILE and that they should pay me my bonus. The process in absolutely opaque and something weird happens. It looks like I need to visit them in the office and finally ask questions. It's really hight chance that I will do it this month. Additionally I received several invitations to interview that it really nice and promising.

# 12 April - Freitag - Berlin - 568 Tag der Einwanderung - Warm Sunny

The day was nice. I finished with some tasks for XU, and finished doing a bunch of improvements for my projects. In general I was at home for a whole day but in the evening me and Ksusha were in Volskpark Freidrichshine. I am not sure that wroted down this title correctly. The place was really nice and it is just in 20 minutes walking from my home. It's really cool that the place is so close to us. Also We can drive to the part on tram that is in 10 minutes walking from our place. It's really cool and I like it. Step by step we started investigating this district and I think that we found really good place for living. Surely it's a little bit more expensive than further places but it worth it.

# 13 April - Samstag - Berlin - 569 Tag der Einwanderung - Warm Sunny

The spring in Berlin is really warm. I heard that it's really unusual weather for the city. So we were today in Amerika House in the city center. We looked at two exhibitions there. The first one was dedicated to some crazy woman that liked to shoot naked photos of herself and another one about rapist and rape as a process. the second exhibition was more interesting for me. Also we baked croissants this morning that were much tastier that in local cafes. I can say that bakeries and cafes here are not so cool. The quality of them in Saint-Petersburg is much better. It's interesting. Also Yesterday I started writing builder v3. It will be the final version on builder. I will plan it better than before. Two proofs of concepts that I did are vey confusing from code perspective I cannot understand anything I did =). Tomorrow we are going to rent a car in the airport and visit Dresden - I believe this trip will be really cool. I miss driving car very much and will be happy to do it again.

# 14 April - Sontag - Berlin - Lübenau - Drezden - 570 Tag der Einwanderung - Warm Sunny

Today we rent a car and were in Lübenau and Drezden. It was interesting and cool trip here. I enjoyed it very much. Lübenau is a small town in 40 minutes drive from Berlin. It's a local touristic point that is called Spreewald or Spree Venice. To be honest it's something overrated but cure at the same time. Also we met a couple there that are some friend of our friend from Saint-Petersburg. They immigrated to Germany 11 years ago and simply it's their place now. Also today was a birthday of their 4 years old son. He can amazingly switch from russian to german without any problems. It's so cool to see how child young brain works. After a short breakfast we said good buy to guys and drove to Drezned. The city is really nice and cute. IT's also a capital of Saxony - another federal lend of Germany. In 1945 this place was destroyed by unnecessary bombing from Allies side. Thousands of people were killed for no reason and the city completely destroyed. However ducring all these 80 years step by step old buildings have been restoring. Now there are a lot of palaces and perfect buildings. The place is really beautiful. Another thing that shocked me is how I rent a car. I just gave my debit card, signed some papares and a clerk gave me keys. I found the car on a parking space and just sat and drove. After that I went back and returned a card automatically. It was very unusual. And finally I really tiered. It was hard but interesting day.

# 15 April - Montag - Berlin - 571 Tag der Einwanderung - Warm Sunny

Today I visited proctologist. I had a one hour trip to another corner of Berlin and did everything. The procedure went very smooth and I didn't have problems. It is a really high chance that I will go to surgery in two weeks. IT's not decided yet but possible. The clinic was nice and cozy. The building looked like I am in some American movie. IT was very interesting for me. The diagnosis is thrombosis. The rest of the day nice and I finished all things that I didn't have time to do yesterday. Also I am going to my family doctor tomorrow. I need to get some paper for the future surgery. Also I got a message from my Dentist that is in Yerevan. She told me that one of surgeries I had last summer was successful. I am happy about it. The german class was cancelled today because the teacher was in consulate in another country. He is on Balkans now, probably in Serbia of Montenegro. I believe he is resolving his immigration problems.

# 16 April - Dienstag - Berlin - 572 Tag der Einwanderung - Cold Cloudy

Today I was in the home doctor office. I got papers that I need to surgery and some medications for the problem on my heel. Besides that I will get a checkup in may that is great. Also I had an interview today that I had to do from cafe that I didn't like. I like talking to people from home or office. Also I was coding for a whole day, now I am really tiered and going to have a rest. In general I don't have anything to add. The only thing I would like to write here down is some characteristics of the doctor. Basically he was in Russia in 2014 in Saint-P and Moscow. Additionally he had a tour on Volga river. In general it's a nice person I will definitely visit him again in the future. So, yes. Tomorrow I am going to the office in the second part of the day.

# 17 April - Mittwoch - Berlin - 573 Tag der Einwanderung - Cold Cloudy

The day was very very good. I tiered as fuck. We finally visited rhethoric club that was very very good. I enjoyed watching how people can speak publically. It's really cool. Ksusha also was happy to see all this stuff. Besides that I had a call with one company that is potentially my future job. I hope that I will get the position but will see. Currently it's not so understandable. I have some hope but will see. In the evening between call and club I was in the office where talk to people and had some little fun. The day was nice in general and I like such days in general. The weather is cold again. It looks like temperature came back to its normal state for Berlin.

# 18 April - Donnerstag - Berlin - 574 Tag der Einwanderung - Cold Cloudy

I was coding for a whole day and to be hones lost the track what I needed to do. I am really tired and want just to lie and die. I had a german class today it was really hard and heavy I feel so stupid and so. Learning is so hard process for me that I just feel myself as a some stupid bag of shit. In the evening just after lesson I was on Berlin React meetup where enjoyed two presentations and then came back home. I still cannot get why people here drink been on professional meetups. I cancelled alcohol finally this year. Before that I could drink some beer or whine but it's not cool at all. So, I decide to just stop drinking this shit. The weather is still bad and cold unfortunately.

# 19 April - Freitag - Berlin - 575 Tag der Einwanderung - Cold Cloudy

So, Finally I am about to be on vacation. It was hard day where I really tiered. In general nothing important happened. I was coding for a whole day and fighting with procrastination. I don't know why but I am already tiered of XU company. I don't see my future there. It's a normal thing from one side and a disaster from another one. I would like to change the job just because of it. It's not my place I feel it. In general it's the first time in my life when I feel it. It's such an interesting experience. It's something new. Yes.

# 20 April - Samstag - Berlin - Venice - 576 Tag der Einwanderung - Cold Cloudy

For some reasons I was really nervous today. The main things and the event of the day was our flight to Venice. Dream comes true. So, I noticed that when I have a flight I become a little bit aggressive. I believe that it's some kind of inner problem. To be honest I realized it for the first time in my life. In the future I will tune my behavior. So, let's go to good things. I finally in Venice. I dreamed about it for whole my life and it's finlay happened. The place looks exactly like I imagined. It's so cool. I am not disappointed. At the same time Ksusha has to carry our luggage today because I have my hemorrhoids and cannot lift heavy weights. It's bad and I feel a little bit useless. Apartments we rent are really good and I enjoyed it very much. (don't need to say that they are really expensive.)

# 21 April - Sonntag  - Venice - 577 Tag der Einwanderung - Cold Cloudy

Today we went to Venice biennale. It's the first such events in my life. We visited a lot of different exhibitions of many countries. The topic was a how to save your culture in modern world. I liked it and saw a lot of cools pieces of art. It's really cool. For a whole day we were walking from place to place and my legs are just in pain. It wasn't easy but enjoyable. The weather was also nice. Unfortunately the forecast is bad and only today the weather was nice. At the same time the city is so perfect that it's absolutely not a problem for me. I took tons of photos that I don't think I publish ever. However they will be my memories for the future like pictures I took in Saint-Petersburg became a history of my life.

# 22 April - Montag  - Venice - 578 Tag der Einwanderung - Cold Rainy

The weather is bad today. it's very rainy and windy I can say. It's a little bit unfortunate but it's what it is. We were sitting for a half of the day at home because of it and because I had an interview and german lesson. I just didn't have time to do everything. Also I was reading, coding, learning german for a whole day. I wasn't disappointed. Tomorrow is my birthday. I will be 36 years old that is shitty. I don't want to become older and older. It's rally sucks. Also today I was on Kuril Chto exhibition. This guy is a Russia artist that moved to Portugal several years ago and quite famous in Russian art society. It was interesting becaise it was the first time when I looked at someone like this from my country but living abroad.

# 23 April - Donnerstag  - Venice - 579 Tag der Einwanderung - Cold Rainy

The weather is better today but still a little bit rainy and cold. I am turned 36 years old now. It's so crazy that it's just hard to believe that I am so old. At the same time a lot of really important people called me and congratulated me with the birthday. It was really good. Ksusha presented some cool little things to me that I liked. After that we visited 5 o'clock in a restaurant that is really popular in extremely rich society. I paid 40 euros for a person and we tried candies, deserted, tea, cakes that were really tasty. I enjoyed it. At the same time this day is the last one in Venice. Tomorrow we are going back to Berlin. So, yea. I hope the weather will be nice, but will see.

# 24 April - Mittwoch  - Venice - Berlin - 580 Tag der Einwanderung - Cold Rainy

It was really hard to carry our baggage in Venice this morning. The city has a lot of bridge that we needed to cross with heavy weight. The worst thing was that I cannot lift heavy things right now and Ksusha had to do it. As a top on the cake, it was heavy raining and we were extremely wet, so to speak. At the same time the flight was smooth and convenient. Everything was nice. The transportation from airport to our home was great and fast. I slept a little bit and did some programming. Also we received electronic auswise letters. it means that our documents are ready. Tomorrow I will go to their office and ask for plastic cards. Maybe they are also ready. After that I need to find a place where I can copy an information from dvd to my flash stick. My dentist asked for an old computer tomography, she wants to compare the current situation to past situation. I hope to find the place. Additionally I will have a german class and another interview.

# 25 April - Donnerstag  - Berlin - 581 Tag der Einwanderung - Cold Cloudy

So, I finally got plastic blaue card. It happened and I am really grad so say that I am fully packed right now. It's sooooo cool. I feel great. Also DR SMILE requested my bank account information. I am about to get final payments. It's soooo cool and nice. Very soon I will receive money that were promised to me several years ago. Also I got an OFFER from company for team engineering manager position. I am so happy about that because it's something absolutely new and cool for me. In general all good. Unfortunately I have some throat pain that makes me sad but not so heavy. I am so happy that I finished proessing all my documents and I am about to get another position in another company. It's something very cool. By the way, they offered 92k to me. Now I am gaining 80k. It's big difference, I calculated that I will have 800 euro more per month. Here it's a nice plus I can even save some money for the future. I really need that managerial experience. I really need. I think that I will jump to this pool.

# 26 April - Freitag  - Berlin - 582 Tag der Einwanderung - Warm Cloudy

The main thing that happened today was that tax office moved me from 3 tax class to 4th one and recalculated all paid taxes from the begining of the year. I recieved a salary in two times less than I expected. So as I understood when we started the process of obtaining of residency we should visit finanzamt and tell them that I am still on 3rd and Ksusha on 5th class. But! they detected her as my wife, gave her 4th class automanically and moved me to 4th as well because it's impossible to have 3rd class when your wife is on 4th. Also since Ksusha doesn't work I should be on 3rd class. Therefore I need to send an application to finanzamt this month - the tuesday is the latest day. In this case they will not charge more taxed from me next month. But I can expect my money back only in 2025. Fuck. it's something incredible. I don't like it but cannot do anything with it. So, I received just 2500 euro approximately and already paid the half of it for my apartments. Additionally I received an frame agreement with Visable and started reading it. I am going to finish this weekend.

# 27 April - Samstag  - Berlin - 583 Tag der Einwanderung - Warm Sunny

Today we were walking for a whole day. It was nice. Firstly we visited salon where Ksusha made brows then we drove at a bus to a market and looked at it. After that we visited Crematory that is beautiful architecture. After that we came back home and did some deals there. In general the day was nice and I cannot recall anything significant. Unfortunately tomorrow is the latest day of my vacation that is sad. I don't want to go back to work. Anyway. I updated my holy theory project a little bit. Tomorrow I have to finish builder3. It's crucial and important thing for me.

# 28 April - Sontag  - Berlin - 584 Tag der Einwanderung - Hot Sunny

The day was nice and really hot. I was on eastside gallery again. I like this place. ALso Mercedes arena is Uber one. It's interesting. I analyzed agreement that Visiable offered to me. I prepared a lot of questions that are important to be answered. Also I did a lot of things. I am good. In the evening we went to the part and had a good time. Everything is nice. I am still very nervous because of everything. It's a trauma to have that shit from tax office. In general the day was nice. Tomorrow I am going to doctor. I hope to have a surgery tomorrow. I think it will be cool and successful.

# 29 April - Montag  - Berlin - 585 Tag der Einwanderung - Hot Sunny

Today I was in the hospital and did some preparations for fridays surgery. yes that's right, the operation will be in the end of the week. Some misunderstanding happened. Anyway It's cool that S85 train carry me without transport switching and it was great. After that I was coding and did a lot of important things. I aligned with my team in XU and also did some coding for them. The another version of HT was released today and this is nice. I also printed a statement for finanzamt that I am going to visit tomorrow morning. The summer weather came back and it's also cool. In general the day was good and I am happy about it.

# 30 April - Dienstag  - Berlin - 586 Tag der Einwanderung - Hot Sunny

So, my months has been finished. In the morning I was in Finanzamt and gave them my statement about changing tax class. The bad news is that it will be almost impossible to get that money back. It's really sad. I never fucked up so much. After that I had a just usual working day. I still try to do things more conscious that usual. I added a new section to the diary that is called notes, where I write my thoughts down. I use Russian language for this because I can better express myself in my native way of communication. It's important. Additionally I had a call with Visable HR and she answered to some my question. I cannot say that all answers satisfied me but I believe that I need to apply that offer and change the position. I need to do this. I came to Germany with a goal to gain my managerial skills, so I am really close to it. I will say yes the day after tomorrow and in one week I will notify XU that I am leaving them. Sadly but this is my way. I also have some dought about XU itself. I was pissed off by cutting the team in two time for no reason I believe. Additionally I still try to send my residence permit to all companies and institutions that need to know about it. I did it for Vivid and Sparkasse as well. Tomorrow is an official holiday. The labor day it's called. We will go to the rosentaler platz and work from a cafe. It's cool to have a variety in our lives.

# 01 May - Mittwoch  - Berlin - 587 Tag der Einwanderung - Hot Sunny

Today was a holiday that I really enjoyed. I did a lot of things during the day including german lesson, programming, some other projects. In general I dedicated the whole day to myself. Tomorrow morning I am going to a doctor and then to the office. I was not there for a while, so I would like to be there, after that I will go a meetup. But it's also depends on my abilities. The day will be hard. Additionally I was on toastmasters meeting and even did some improvisation. I enjoyed it very much and liked it a lot. Something really cool was in that meeting. I contacted to some people there and spent great time. I will definitely join the next one. It will be on the next week and if I am ok I will join it. Now I need to go to the bathroom and to sleep. The day was nice but it's over.

# 02 May - Donnerstag  - Berlin - 588 Tag der Einwanderung - Hot Sunny

Today I was in the doctor office and gave them my blood. It's the first step of my health checkup that I really want to do. I came to him and all procedure took just 10 minutes. Just after that I went to the XU office and spent cool time there. Me and my colleges had a great dinner there and cool conversation about everything. It was really cool. After that I came back home and my german lesson was cancelled because of my teacher's vacation. He told that an internet connection was really poor at his place and we decided to do a lesson then Monday according the schedule. Tomorrow I am going to surgery which is very important thing. Additionally I send the email to Visible that I would like to join their company. I also asked additional questions. I expect to have them angered tomorrow. So, yes. I've been changing my job.

# 03 May - Freitag  - Berlin - 589 Tag der Einwanderung - Hot Sunny

The surgery went smooth. I went to the hospital early morning and did all preparations they asked me to do. I did everything well and if you see this lines I am still alive. It's really cool. Ksusha supported me and went to the hospital to pick me up. Without her I should be there for 24 hours. It's a very important part of healing process. Surely I feel pain and my mood is not so good, but I needed to do this. After that I need to focus on sport again, in other case the situation will repeat. I also got a call from Visable and we clarified several question I asked. The conversation was nice and went well. Everything was nice. Addionally DR SMILE didn't send me an email they promised. I am not surprised because they are really poorly organized. In general the day was nice.

# 04 May - Samstag  - Berlin - 590 Tag der Einwanderung - Hot Sunny

So, today I felt ok and we even went for a walk in the city. We visited nice greek cafe and then went to designer week. The exhibition was so bad that I could not imagine that so big world center like Berlin can have so badly done events. The good side of it that I got two shoppers (bags) and ate some snacks for free. It was nice. In the evening I did nothing and had a rest. Unfortunately It's imposible to recover after surgery in one day. anyway, I don't feel bad and it's nice. Maybe the situation will change. I will see. Oh, the one big difference I wanted to say, here in Germany doctors tend to avoid medications if they are not necessary. It's a big difference from russian or armenian doctors. The russian medical school tend to prescribe medication in order to decrease the level of uncomfortableness.

# 05 May - Sonstag  - Berlin - 591 Tag der Einwanderung - Hot Sunny

Today I did a short walk in the morning and we had a big cleaning. I hate such things especially that I have some continuances of the surgery. However I tried to do my best and clan everything well. I believe I did a great job. Ksusha also did everything very very well. In general I was so tiered that I just had laid down to my bad and spent the rest of the day there. Also I wanted to menton that I started reading autobiography of George Washington last week. It's so interesting to dive intro the so well shaped text every that it was translated to russian. Surely the words are different but the text structure is the same. Maybe in the future I need to do some analysis of the text. Right now I just enjoy the text and read it. It's cool, smart, and interesting.

# 06 May - Montag  - Berlin - 592 Tag der Einwanderung - Hot Sunny

This monday was calm and simple. Nothing really impressive happened today. I just spent some time on work and did other tasks. I am going to writing mentality step by step. I am closer to this every day. I like it very much. It looks like a future for me. I need to change my effort to a little bit other direction. It's a fact. I am so bored with programming and tiered of it. Maybe something will happen and I will back to coding but for now I just don't want to do it. Something really changed in my mind. It's so strange.

# 07 May - Dienstag  - Berlin - 593 Tag der Einwanderung - Hot Sunny

A lot of things changed today. Firstly I was in my doctor office. He explained what I had in my blood test results. Everything is fine in general. Also he asked me to sit at home this week and don't do anything. I am happy about it because it is a legal opportunity for me to just have a rest. Additionally I visited Dr SMILE office and one guy from the company helped me to talk to lawyer and get payout letter. It's really cool. Thank you Tobi. After that I met Jürgen. He is a CTO of Wunderflats the company that I could not join six month ago approximetely. I texted to this person and offered to have a lunch and he finally texted to me back. This meeting was nice. Also I had a german class today. I finally started undestanding this damn language a little bit.

# 08 May - Mittwoch  - Berlin - 594 Tag der Einwanderung - Hot Sunny

The sum that I got from payout letter is so low that I can understand why they asked me to sign additional NDA. It's so crazy. DRSMILE feels really bad. it's crazy. Anyway this about of money will be enough for me to fix my teeth finally. I am happy about it. In the evening I was on toastmasters meeting. It was cool and I enjoyed all activiites and speaches of that people. In the future when I join ot the place I can even add it to my CV. I will definetly do it. Also I signed a contract with Visable. I will be a part of the company. I need to say about it to XU in a week. Another page of my life has turned.

# 09 May - Donnerstag  - Berlin - 595 Tag der Einwanderung - Hot Sunny

Today I just did nothing. It's a holiday in Berlin and we were chilling for a chole day. Additionally we cleaned the apartment that is very important and nice. I like to be in a cleaned place. To be hones I don't know what to add here. I finished a autobiography by Franklin. It was nice and I was impressed by the person and the how he impacted the world and the US in general.

We were thinking about visiting of Rugen island but cancelled the idea due to a bad weather there. It's sad but not so because I feel bad after surgery. Nothing happened. I don't understand why doctors didn't presribed antibiotics to me. My ass is in pain. I decided to start using one gel that helped me when I was surgered last time in Russia. However my condition is not so good. It's crazy. As I see my body cannot handle it easily. It's sad.

The gel I started using for recovery is really helping me. I don't feel well but better than yesterday for example. The recovery process is so slow that I don't know what to think. It's crazy. Howevery I am trying to be calm and not overrating my confition. I am trying to behaive well and correctly in such nerviouse situation. Additonally I lost a piece of tooth. It's sad because I will see a dentist in August in a best case. Until that moment I need to save the tooth somehow.

The day wasn't so differenct from all others I had. It was a cheat meal day that I usually really like. We were on a lake today and were walking there. I still in shock that Berlin is so green city. It's surely a big metropolice in the central Europe but the weather is extremely cool and all other things about climate are also nice. I was working on builder3 today a lot wich is not so new thing but very important. In two week I will be on aother job that is makes me really nervouse.

I recieved really horrible news today. One of my close fiends Паша Пащеня passed away. He suffered from diabetis and had other health issues. Let me be frank, he was an alcoholic and his death is the end of his habits. It was so bad piece of news that I was crying first time for many months. I was citting in ST.Oberholz when Andrey Odinsov texted me about it. Surely I could not do anything else today. I am in shock. Luckily today is a holiday and I don't have any work for XU.

I needed to bring a signed contract. So I did it. Additionally I was in the XU office and did some other things. The guy that supposed to be from Morocco is actually from Saudi Arabia. I could not expect this. Now I understand why he is so religious. It's normal. In the evening I was on a product meetup that wasn't so interesting but I decided to refresh myself in some other society.

# 22 May - Mitwoch - Berlin - 608 Tag der Einwanderung - Hot Sunny
