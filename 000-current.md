I hate day of fool. It's always a piece of shit. However nobody pranked me and I am happy about it. At the same time I did a lot of cool things during the day. I learned some stuff and released another version of Holy Theory. On bad thing happened to me. It looks like my haemorrhoids came back to me. I need to have some relief but I don't know how. The situation is dangerous again.

The same weather like yesterday. I feel worse today. We even got a couple of new termins to doctors. I hope to visit them on the next week. I hope to see them really. It looks like I am very close to surgery again. WIll see. I try to get some specific pills that can help me. I need to be on diet now that is sad but important to me. Besides that I did a lot of good things again. I was coding and did some investigation things. To be honest my illness pushed my mood down again. It's painful really. At the same time I still have an illusion that medications will help me.

The day was nice. Nothing fency happened. I still don't feel good. However I did a lot of good things and it's really cool. The day after tomorrow I will go to a doctor and get something him. I hope that my insurance will cover the visit. I really hope. I don't have money for this now. I think everything will be ok. I also have a termin to proctologist and it's  good.

Today I also feel ok. Surely I cannot postpone the visit to doctor. It's cool that I am going to him tomorrow morning. I found all papers I received last time when I had surgery. I am sure that It will help me tomorrow. I also need to be in schedule again. I am not so motivated to work in XU. The stopping working with the Polish team hit me very much. I could not expect this. Currently I need to change my behavior's strategy. Besides that I just was in the bed for a hole day. I could do much due to pain. I drink pills and other medication but for me even sitting is uncomfortable now. I hate this illness. Vein system is my weak point. After treatment that I suppose to get tomorrow I will do much more sport. I really don't want to have this again.
