# 01 June - Samstag - Berlin - 618 Tag der Einwanderung - Hot Sunny

I did a maniqure today and it was enjoyful for me. I will repeat it definitely. Then we were on templhof field and walked a lot. I enjoyed the day. In general I did just nothing and it was nice. This saturday was really nice and calm. I only learned a little bit german. Sometimes it's just cool to do nothing. Neighbours were screaming for a whole evening due to football match. Dortmund plated with Real. And lost.

I liked this Sunday. I did tons of things. For example I prepared a technical task for a freelancer that supposed to fix Mostmag finally. I am tiered of removing virus and I don't have enough time for it. I did my homework and prepared for tomorrow's onboarding in Visable. It's nice. I am happy to change the job. I hope to be good manager and will do it. Additionally I am glad to see nice progress with Holy Theory project. I am about to finish all things regarding builder and very soon it will be ready for new books. It's really cool. Now I will go to have a little bit rest. Oh, I forgot to mention. Very soon I am flying to Paris. Tickets are already bought.

Today was my the first day in Visable company. I experienced a nice onboarding in the morning and recieved a pretty cool laptop for work. I was surprices because I didn't expect so nice thing. It's m3 laptop with tons of memory. In the end of the day I was really tired and barely could think. Because of visiting of the office I had to cancel german lesson. I don't like when something like this happened. It was sad. I also met some of my new colleegs. Yes. Final good buy to xu company. It was intersting buy I will not miss it.

I have to rearrange my schedule because It's it really hard to do things now. I don't have time. This day was really hard. Tons of onboarding meetings just expoded my mind. I also was in the office today because I needed to be there. I cannot say that it was really enjoyable but still. I needed to be there. In common this comapny has a specific policy that forces people to be in the office twice per week. All other time we can work at home. It's not so good but me as a part of IT department can break the rule. I can be in the office 8 day in a row and then I can fomr home until the end of the month.

# 05 June - Mittwoch - Berlin - 622 Tag der Einwanderung - Warm Sunny

I was working from home for a whole day. I started scheduling meeting with my programmers. I have 5 people under me that is really nice for me. I wan't to esablish my skills better and better. So I need to work on it a lot. At the same time I found some minimal time for my own projects. All of the are hevily important for me. In the evening I was in Toastmasters club as a member for the first time. I need to find a time somewhere for dealing with all of this and understand what happened on the webside. The speaker career is important. This skill is essencial.

# 06 June - Donnerstag - Berlin - 623 Tag der Einwanderung - Warm Sunny

Today I had an arguments with Ksusha. It's really rare situation when we conflict. It was hard. I almost did nothing. I could only to concetrate somehow and visit German lesson. The day was horrible. Also I cannot undertand if dr smile sent me money or not. It looks like they fucked me up again. I hate them so much. They are absolutely insane and stupid morons. It's something unbelivable.

# 07 June - Freitag - Berlin - 624 Tag der Einwanderung - Warm Rainy

We are ok now. I believe that huge pressure that we experienced broke us a little bit. Luckily we handled this. Today I worked from home and it was good. I didn't do a lot of things because it's really hard to memorize everything. At the same time I did good progress this week in Visable. I talked to all people that I leed and it's really cool thing. I am happy about it. Funny thing is that this friday makes me really happy because I need to have a little rest. Well deserved rest.

# 08 June - Samstag - Berlin - 625 Tag der Einwanderung - Warm Sunny

I did literally nothing today. We were on closed radar station that was built by the US army during the cold war. It's a bunch of buildings are located on an artificial mountain in the Berlins part. I already forgot the name of it. The place is really cool. Berlin is stuffed by amazing places and all of them are cool and interesting. Also it's my first year in the country and that means I am still curious of everything happens here.

# 09 June - Sonnstag - Berlin - 626 Tag der Einwanderung - Cold Sunny

I decided to change an approach to the Holy Theory project. Before that I did weekly releases but now I don't have time. I am goung to change them to monthly ones. Tomorrow I will publish an article of it. At the same time I need to finalize the project in one month because I did good work but didn't do a workable proto. I need to change it. Besides that the weather changed and ruined all our plans. It's not a surprise because we are still in Europe.

# 10 June - Montag - Berlin - 627 Tag der Einwanderung - Cold 

The weather turned to really cold. I worked from home today and didn't go anywhere. It's just cold. Besides that nothing really fancy happened. I still don't have money from fucking DR SMILE. Tomorrow I am going to escalate the problem. If they don't change anything I will go to the their office and force them to talk to me in person. It's so stupid. Oh I forgot to mention it. They forgot to send moey to me. Fucking morons. I believe that they will fix it this week.

# 11 June - Diestag - Berlin - 628 Tag der Einwanderung - Cold Rainy

I had a full day of meeting today because I decided that tuesday is a good day for it. I am so tiered that I just cannot describe it. Also I try to resolve problem with my money. Oh how I hate them. In the eveniny I was on a meeting with CEO of Deutsche bank. He lies so well. I countes a couple of dozens rethorical trics and avoiding questions. He is very cool in it. I will publish an post about this meting next week.

# 12 June - Mittwoch - Berlin - 629 Tag der Einwanderung - Cold Rainy

# 13 June - Donnerstag - Berlin - 630 Tag der Einwanderung - Cold Rainy

I really like working from home. It makes me happy. So I did it. My working day are so intencive now that I really don't know what to say. Maybe I need to change an approach for making this notes. In the evening I had a nice german lesson. I started gradually understand something and it is really good. Maybe I will know German quite well in near future. Until then I need to work harder on it than I already do.

# 14 June - Freitag - Berlin - 631 Tag der Einwanderung - Cold Rainy

I finally got an answer from that morons. They sent my money yesterday, I hope they are not so crazy and I will recive them on monday. As craziness I mean possible mistakes that they can do in the payment statement. Also I am happy to be in Friday again. It means that I will have a cool weekend. Adtionaly I wouldlike to say that our relations with Ksusha is absolutely brilliant now. I'm happy. I love her so much and don't want to loose her.

# 15 June - Samstag - Berlin - 632 Tag der Einwanderung - Warm Sunny

The weather became normal finally. However I did literally nothing today I was at home and did nothing. Also I forgot to write here down that I was in the cinema this week. It was the first time in my life when I watched a movie without subtitles. The language was english subs were in german. Therefore I could not use text in the screen. It was cool and successful thing because I enjoyed the movied and understood everything.

# 16 June - Sonnerstag - Berlin - 633 Tag der Einwanderung - Warm Sunny

I finally did some cleaning in the apartments today. It's nice. Absence of time on my and Ksusha's sides lead us to dirty rooms that I don't like. Also I had a call with Arsenii and showed him Berlin a little bit. He was happy to talk to me. Also I finally finished thing that I postponed. The reason was absence of time. I am good and did a great job. If money from fucking smile will come to me tomorrow I will be much more happy than now. I hate them really. In general the day was nice and good. I liked it. I did a lot of things but also had a good rest.

# 17 June - Montag - Berlin - 634 Tag der Einwanderung - Warm Rainy

Money are not here. It's so annoying. I will wait until tommorow and if nothing changes escalate the problem. Today was a home office day. I just sat at home and did some business. It's really hard to do things without strong experience. It's something absolutely new. I try to be everywhere and to do things correctly. It's hard in general. Visable is my first company where I am a lead from the beginnig.
