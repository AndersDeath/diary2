# 01 June - Thursday - Kaş - 245 day of immigration

Someone found my github with tons of commits and deicide that I don't do job and just push something to repositories. It's something new in my career. I considered it as a risk when I started doing this project. I mean holy theory project. I don't care what others think about it. I'm completely tiered of this stuff and I cannot carry it anymore. Maybe I think a lot more about it that I should. Anyway I need to fix this situation somehow. I think I need to share what I do to others. I will start from Fedor tomorrow and then maybe share it with Olga. After that I want ti make a call with my team and share this to them. Let's see what will happen. I need to show myself as a strong person that is absolutely sure in his believes. So, I am such person. I think I will fix the problem this way. I hope so.

# 02 June - Friday - Kaş - 246 day of immigration

I talked to Fedor today. He is absolutely ok with things that I do. On Monday I will talk to Olga about my activities and try to resolve the situation. It's really hard to do anything when you have doubts. However I had a nice call with one startup today which has cool conception and I want to try myself in the next interview. Surprisingly they support relocation which is amazing. I hope that I will pass an interview with them because the process is quite simple. But let see. It's not so clear now. Besides that this day was nice and did a lot of things. The mood wasn't so good but I am cool. Tomorrow is holiday and I am happy about that. It will help me to refresh.

# 03 June - Saturday - Kaş - 247 day of immigration

Today I tried to record pppodcast. For some reasons the sound recorded poor and I should to redo it without external mic. At the same time it's the last saturday in this trip to Turkey. We were on beautiful beach. The weather is quite windy today and we didn't swim. Actually we didn't swim at all due to the weather. It's not so good as last year. However I spent great time on it. I was thinking a lot about programming again. I do pretty well in this area for the last time. I'm happy about it. At the same time my condition and mood became much better. Step by step I adopt to new lifestyle that I have to have. I still worry about my ability to pass technical interviews. I will have the nearest one in the wednesday. It will be some kind of crash test for me. I ruined the latest test that I got from Parkos. It's because I thought that I am able to do something in vuejs. In fact I wasn't and just spent 2.30 hour without good result. Bad result is also nice but still. So, now I will go to have a dinner. I am quite hungry today. I spent a couple hours driving and it tiered me. So, I will go. See you tomorrow people.

# 04 June - Sunday - Kaş - 248 day of immigration

This day was nice. We had a nice walk in the town and on peninsula. The weather was extremely hot. All people went to beach and it was impossible to fide a place for freshing up. At the same time I did nothing and just had a rest. On Tuesday night I will be already in Yerevan. I want to come back to the city. We decided to rent an apartments for a long time. I'm happy that we did it. Actually apartments in Yerevan became much chipper that I expected. It's possible to rent an apartment in the city center for reasonable price. Immigration wave stopped. The only thing that I don't like in Yerevan is absence of the sea. It's sad really. I hope that everything will be ok and we leave car successfully and flight will be smooth. Last time I lost so much nerves that I don't want to repeat it again. Another fun fact is that Ksusha started using chatgpt and she likes it. It's nice and something new. I hope that it'll help her a lot. All these AI stuff is very interesting. I will dive into it more and more.

# 05 June - Monday - Kaş - 249 day of immigration

Today I had a nice talk to Olga about the situation with Holy Theory. I will do the next talk with my team tomorrow. I gonna share the information about it and try to convince them that this project is absolutely side. At the same time today the last full day in Kash for us. WE are going to Yerevan tomorrow. We will be there in the middle of the night. I'm happy to come back to Yerevan. We are going to rent an apartments for long term. I want to collect some money until the autumn starts. This savings will be nice in case of relocation. Comstruct fucked me. The CTO guy convinced me that the wanted to send an interview invitation, but he lied. I sent an email to him and his rejected me. Such a bastard. So, anyway I will have an technical interview in wednesday. I'll do in from Yerevan's apartments. I hope an internet connection will be find, but we'll see. 

# 06 June - Tuesday - Kaş - Antalia - 250 day of immigration

So, I am sitting in Antalia airport now. We arrived and check out the car successfully. I got my 200 euros back. It's so cool people. I so stressed last time and it's just hard for me to handle all problems. However I'm doing well I suppose. I mentioned in one the previous diary notes that we decided to rent an apartments for ling term. I personally didn't want to tie myself to Yerevan but I will. I really want to have something like normal life. I hope everything will be good and I will find a way how to immigrate to some another country. I event don't thing about EU as a priority. I saw some bullshit last time. At the same time It's very expensive place. I feel pain when think about it. Nevermind. This night I will be in Yerevan. It's cool because I will live in the city center for a month. If I find some cool apartments in the city center I can even proceed living there. It's very attractive stuff. Yerevan's center is amazing. I liver in the Kentron district for a wile and was impressed. There is everything that I need for normal living. It's really nice. Another cool district is arabkir. I think that it will be nice to live there as well.

# 07 June - Wednesday - Yerevan - 251 day of immigration

I'm here again. The apartment is nice. I live exactly in the city center. I did some x-ray puctures this morning. I'm ready for surgery that'll happen on Friday. It'll be hard, but I really want my teeth back. I also had a technical interview with some guy. I hope to get some feedback soon. Maybe we will proceed working with him, maybe not. I have no idea. It will be understandable later. I'm so tiered today. The flight wasn't in the middle of the night, but still. Fun thing is that only few people were in the airplane. It was my first time to travel in almost empty plane. It's interesting by the way. Tomorrow the day will be easier. I resolved some crusial things and now just can wait for the surgery. Ksusha started applying for senior developer position and I have a big bunch of interviews. This is nice. Maybe I will find a job as a developer. We will see. I don't know.

# 08 June - Thursday - Yerevan - 252 day of immigration

So, I was working for whole day as usual. I wrote code and did some other important things. In the evening we went for a short walk and just got some "fresh" air. Actually it's hard to find good air here. Yerevan has some ecological problems and apparently they don't have money for fixing them. Another important thing that tomorrow I will go to have surgery. Finally. After tomorrow's operation I will be ready for making prosthetics. I'm really happy about that. I will be nice and beauty. However the main thing will be recovering of chewing function. It's really hard for me now to eat some poducts. My teeth aren't ready for it. The only one thing is here that I don't want to experience. Obviously it's pain. I bought some pills that will help me. The previous pain syndrome was so rough that I barely handled it. It was crazy. So, good luck to me tomorrow.

# 09 June - Friday - Yerevan - 253 day of immigration

Today I got surgery and 6 (six) gum formers. Everything is nice now but I feel bad. I have no power. However I did all things from my todolist. I cancelled sport and some other things. I was lying in the bad for the half of day. This is a main point for this day. Tommorow we will go for a walk and to do some other cool stuff. I really want this weekend. The monday is also day off. It will be day of Russia or something like this. Actually I don't have a lot of updated today. Maybe only that I also got an appointment in dentist clinic in 10 days. We will start doing my new teeth. I suppose to have new stiff in 2 or 3 weeks.

# 10 June - Saturday - Yerevan - 254 day of immigration

I watched new spider man animated movie today. The plot is super stupid but animation is amazing. we also walked around the city center today. It was nice and cool. The weather was quite rainy today. It wasn't a problem but still. Despite the rain the temperature outside is high. Yerevan is hot place in summer. I feel a bit better today. Unfortunately I have annoying pain. I think I will be ik in one week. I can't wait for my new teeth. I've going to this for very long time. It's three years process. I wanted to finish it in Russia. The war changed everything. I hope that I will stop saying it one day. It's so weird  that we came back to yerevan two days ago but I feel like i didn't go from the country. It's strange that this city become so important for me. Armenia is nice country. I like this place. I cannot be an Armenia unfortunately. Maybe in some day I will find my place. I don't know. Will see.

# 11 June - Sunday - Yerevan - 255 day of immigration

This sunday is amazing. I did a lot of things I red a book, learned Spanish, wrote articles. Nice day is general. Ksusha recorded her the first blog video which is nice. I think she has everything for doing great videos without any problems. She can speak well. She looks great. She is smart. I really love her. Tomorrow in russia day which brings us another holiday. I will have another 3 introduction interviews with some companies. It will be nice I suppose. The chance to proceed dealing with them is pretty small. You know that this interview period is hard. It's really difficult to have another interview step after the first introduction. The situation is not easy. However I will proceed doing it even though I am sick of it.

# 12 June - Monday - Yerevan - 256 day of immigration

Today is dayoff. I was working on my things for a whole day. It was nice. I finished russian version of article about Holy Theory. This is amazing because I need to publish much more texts on my blog. I think that I finally got in what role I feel better. At the same time I feel much better here in Yerevan. It feels like home. Maybe I even finally start recoding some stuff in English. I don't know. It really depends on my mood. i still feel not so confident in English but I speak using the language every day. Luckily this became my second language. I learn spanish now. Maybe in several years I will be good in it as well. I don't know. Without daily practice it will be hard to achieve. Will see.

# 13 June - Tuesday - Yerevan - 257 day of immigration

Today I visited barbershop which is amazing. My gum still pains. I hope that this shit will be better at the end of the week. In general week started well because I had 4 day offs in a raw. Unfortunately I have to start the new week. Tomorrow's evening I will have several calls with some companies. what will be the result is hard to predict. I really don't know what to do with it. However I adopted to this kind of lifestyle. I prepare to calls everyday. I talk to a lot of people. Maybe or probably I will have some positive impact. I really want to immigrate to some other county but It's really hard. Maybe I will find a way how to do it. every day I think about it. Samurai doesn't have a goal he has only a path. I try to be aligned with this rule. But I feel how time leaks to some place away from me. It's tough. Also I started reading Matthew Perry book. It's quite easy read and it's cool because I am really interested in his biography. He was a cool actor and his Fried's character was amazing. I know what I say because I watch this series every day. It's really cool. Maybe I will also get some new expressions and words from the book. Usually it works for me.

# 14 June - Wednesday - Yerevan - 258 day of immigration

Today I had another interview with Doctoflix. I went nice. The rest of the day I was programming and making some usual things. Todoist is amazing tool that helps we on daily basis and it's amazing. my gum pains. It's awful. In general I so calm now. I don't know why but I feel better. I still miss home but it's not so painful. maybe if I go to Russia I will feel bad. But I don't have such plans. Maybe in one of two years I will go to Russia. It's so unclear. I forgot to say I had another interivew with huge company for backend position. It will be unusual code assessment I suppose. I will try to do my best but I don't thing that It will be ok. I just want to try and made notes about BE interview questions.

# 15 June - Thursday - Yerevan - 259 day of immigration

The situation is that I have much more interivews for engineering positions that for managerial. It's not a surprise but still. I had one interivew today and scheduled a couple more for the next week. It's crazy contrast to management positions. I also was programming for whole day. At the same time I felt a huge pain in my gum for whole day. One specific gel helped me a lot and I don't feel pain now. I also was talking to Suman who is my backend engineer. We were talking about India again. It's our common topic. I was there. He is from that place. India is a completely different world. Every time it's cool to talk to him. I also decided to switch my focus to MERN stack. I want to recall some stuff from backend and recall how to do fullstack development. It's really hard to remember everything but I have to. I still want to be a manager but this way is much longer in my case. I have this immigration problem and stuff that push me to engineering back. I like do code but I really wanted to have more managerial tasks. Will see. I do everything to achieve it.

# 16 June - Friday - Yerevan - 260 day of immigration

Today I had a lot of meeting. It was crazy. I almost didn't have time to work. Gum still pains. I have only three days for treating it. Tomorrow is day when I can eat everything I want. I am happy. At the same time I extremely tiered. I just want to sleep. I really need to finish with video this weekend. I will wake up early and start working on it. I also need to finish translation of the article about holy theory. I spent so much time on meetings this week that it's something crazy. Moreover I will have more meetings next week. On sunday I need to investigate shares/equities topics. Ksusha found nice articles about it. I hope it'll be easy.

# 17 June - Saturday - Yerevan - 261 day of immigration

Well, today I did almost nothing. I learned languages, programmed a bit, eat burger and crousan. i forgot about pizza and cup of coffee. Yesterday I recall about the fact that I studied finnish language at school. This is so cool. Just for a record Finnish is one of languages that I would like to know. I am not crazy only about Spanish. In general this day was good. Nastya started packing things in our Saint-Petersburg apartments. It's sad because I wanted to do it. It's really disappointed stuff. I miss home. If this immigration would be my own choice, I would have reacted easier.

# 18 June - Sunday - Yerevan - 262 day of immigration

Another Sunday, another week finished. It's so weird how live goes fast. Something happens every day and doing life different. Today we just did some cool things and went for a walk. I changed a bit my plans and decided to dive deeper into MERN stack or something similar. I also investigated some literature and articles about stack options and shares. These are papers that a person can get if join to a startup. Tomorrow I'm gonna meet a guy who is an investor and co-founder of doctorflix startup. It will be interesting call and also it will the further step that I will achieve for the last five months. It so crazy how much time I spent on interviews. I really wanted moving to some managerial position but in fact it's impossible. The market is so tight and it's really hard to find a job. Anyway I will see what I will get tomorrow. Maybe it will be just another piece of shit. I don't know.

# 19 June - Monday - Yerevan - 263 day of immigration

i was in clinic today. unfortunately my gum isn't ready and I have to postpone the operation until friday. It's really sad but I hae to wait. I was working a lot on other things today including the article about holy theory. I used chatGPT for correcting but the text became complex. It's obviouse that I cannot speak and write that way. I will redo it tomorrow morning. The article should be published on wednesday. the call with drflix was nice but I still don't know what impact and aswer I can expect from them. I will know about it soon. Another interview was absolutely waste of time. I don't think that i can work for them. It's crazy i think. Thats it for today.

# 20 June - Tuesday - Yerevan - 264 day of immigration

Today I tried to fix Btrise building issue again. I think that it's one of the poorest documented services ever. I had a incredibly huge problems with this system a couple of years ago. It was a traumatic experience.  I also was working on article about holy theory. I have to publish it tomorrow, I got this obligations. I will do it tomorrow. I also need to put myself together and finish editing of the new immigration diary video. I have to do it until the end of the week. In general this day was nice and very productive. I suppose that tomorrow will be also nice. Oh, I forgot to mention that I had an interview with one company today. I hope that I will have some interview rounds.

# 21 June - Wednesday - Yerevan - 265 day of immigration

I am so tiered. I had a tech interview. It was hard. I didn't expect this kind of tasks that I got. I think I didn't pass. It was unsuccessful I suppose. It's sad but true. From another side I published an article about Holy Theory. Finally. This is really cool because I was working on it for a quite long time. I hope that it will be useful. In general I did everything I had in my list. I impressed by my productivity. I try to recall when I was in so good pace last time. Honestly, I've never done so many things. Even more I never was so dived into new technologies and more. This is really cool. It worth in any case. Besides the english skills I train my thinking way and become better. I still feel like I am pretender. Absence of degree makes this with me. I still dream about obtaining some diploma. Maybe it will happen. I don't know. As now it is not a problem. I have more difficult things here. I want to have it for my own confidence. I want to be a scientist. I am a face now.

# 22 June - Thursday - Yerevan - 266 day of immigration

I got a rejection from yesterdays interview. this is sad. I didn't do anything good. I also had another two interviews today. The first company was just a piece of shit. The another one looks very serious. I like it really. The rest of the day I was working hard on different things like ionic bullshit and so. tomorrow I will stop adding new tasks to holy theory project. I will concentrate my attention on already added stuff and inventing some custom tasks. So, I will try to improve my skills. I am really tiered of all this process. It kills me day by day. I hope to find something soon. I am on the edge.

# 23 June - Friday - Yerevan - 267 day of immigration

I didn't do a lot of things today. but I went to the doctor and he made casts from the jaws for the manufacture of prostheses this is really amazing. because I will have new teeth soon. This is really cool. I cannot wait for it. I'm so tiered of such disability. I suppose that one day I will  have all teeth replaced. Sometimes I wish it faster. I also did some learning stuff today. It was cool and short. So, in general the day was nice. I still have a lot of doubts about looking for a job, but in general everything is nice. I also had a short call with Nastya today. I can say that I miss her. She prepares our things for moving to another apartments. I miss my home. I still cannot feel home here fully. It's still immigration but not a calm living with bright thoughts about future. Maybe one day I will feel better. I don't know. Now it seems impossible.

# 24 June - Saturday - Yerevan - 268 day of immigration

Last night was interesting. Private army Vagner rioted and occupied Rostov na Donu. these illegal army fight not only with ukrain but also with official ministry of defense. I waited the civil war beginning for whole day but now I we got good news that this army decided to stop moving to Moscow. Actually it's good because the situation was really dangerous. Nobody wants civil war in Russia. It's nuclear country with powerful nuclear weapon. It is madness. All other day was nice. We was walking a lot. we bought tickets to Gyumri for the next Saturday, sent new rental statement to Saint-Petersburg, and selected some apartments in Yerevan that we will probably rent here. So, day was nice. I am happy to be out of Russia. I still want come back home but it's not a time yet. I'm afraid that this shit gonna go for a long time. It's madness.

# 25 June - Sunday - Yerevan - 269 day of immigration

We walked a lot today. The weather was very hot. We also found one apartments that we will visit tomorrow. If all good we will rent this place. In general it's not so obvious what we'll see. I paid for Duolingo. I like this app it helps me a lot in learning. I will start studying german as well. I don't think that it worth but anyway. It's good training for my brain. Alzgamer will shot me much later than others. At the same time I just did nothing today and this is amazing.

# 26 June - Monday - Yerevan - 270 day of immigration

I've been in the one apartment today that we might rent. It's nice place not so far from metro. Additionally Ksusha found an agent that will help us with looking for an apartment. She already sent some variants. If all good we will check them soon. This is good basically. I also was working for whole day on different important things. I published another update for Holy Theory and had a call with one company that is looking for an senior engineer. At the same time the situation with doctoflix became annoying because I really need some answer. I don't want texting them directly but still. The situation is not so good for me unfortunately. I miss old good times when I just did everything super quick and effective. I don't know but I thing that my brain should work nice event at 35 years old.

# 27 June - Tuesday - Yerevan - 271 day of immigration
