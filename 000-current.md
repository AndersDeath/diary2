# 01 October - Sunday - Saint-Petersburg - 367 day of immigration

I met Mom and aunt Anya today. I was happy to see them. I met mother in the city center on Nevsky prospect after that I visited Anya on Chkalovskaya. She lives on Kupchinskaya street. It was meeting. I enjoyed it. After that I met Ksusha and we went to Sevkabel port. It's a cultural place on Vasilyevskiy ostrov. In general the day was nice. We finished preparation of documents. Tomorrow we will go to the visa center and at 3pm we will sit to Spsan and go to Tver. There we will met Igor and he will drive us to Rzhev. After one day there we are going to Moscow and back to Yerevan. The only concern is how I will cross the border. It's not so clear. I hope that there will be no problems. Will see. Now I am sitting in Nastya's studio and waiting for Ksusha. oh, We also were in Balagan food court. It's a nice place on Chkalovskaya with a lot of nice mini-restaurants. I was there before and I was happy to visit that place again. So, also I need to take a shower and go to sleep. I am quite tiered and would be happy to have a rest. Good day.

# 02 October - Monday - Saint-Petersburg - Rzhev - 368 day of immigration

So, My application is in visa center. We spent 2.5 hours there. It was really crazy. One hour was burned for checking my document pocket and another 40 minutes for getting fingerprints. Other minutes were burned for waiting, payments and waiting, waiting, waiting... It was hard. However we finished with it and after that we packed our luggage and arrived to Tver on Sapsan. Igor - Ksusha's mother husband met us there and drove to Rzhev. Oh, I forgot we met my mom in metro in te morning. It was just for a couple of minutes but very pleasant. I miss my mom and for others. The full tomorrow we will be here but the day after tomorrow we are going to Moscow and fly back to Yerevan. I am still worried about crossing the border. I hope everything will be ok. In general the was good. The only bad thing is that Ksusha is sick and feels bad. Maybe she will be better tomorrow.

# 03 October - Tuesday - Rzhev - 369 day of immigration

Today I was working on my portfolio a lot. The scope from DS is still unclear. I just ignore a lot of things there. Maybe today someone can give me a direction for work. I don't care anymore. Fuck them. Also ME and Ksusha were in Arabica cafe which is in the city center of Rzhev. It's nice place with average food but with great coffee. It's one of the best cafes I even been. After that we visited Ksusha's grandmother. She is 80 years old but looks good despite the cancer disease . She is in remission now. I hope everything will be ok with her. Another thing is that I got sick. I think I just got it from Ksusha because she did't feel good since we left Yerevan. She is much better now but I have all this symptoms. I hope to be ok because tomorrow we are going to Moscow and I need to recover a bit. Nevermind. I think everything will be good.

# 04 October - Wednesday - Rzhev - Moscow - 370 day of immigration

So, I am writing these lines sitting on chair in Rzhev. In 30 minutes we are going to bus and then will have a long drive to Moscow. I suppose it will be for about 4 hours including traffic. It's impossible to avoid this problem sadly. We will sleep at hotel in Domodedovo airport and tomorrow's morning flying to Yerevan. I hope that it will not be a problem with crossing the border. I sill have a hope. At the same time our document are already in German embassy in Moscow. If everything is good we will get an answer soon. After that we need a wait a bit for Ksusha's visa and then we are ready to go. I still think a lot about Germany. As I mentioned before It will be another step in our lives. I don't know how Ksusha will adapt her deals and business there but I am sure that I will help her. At the same time I got funny story from my our owners of apartments. I will copy the story from watsup soon. It's really interesting.

# 05 October - Thursday - Moscow - Yerevan- 371 day of immigration

I woke in Maxima hotel at Domodedovo airport. It's quite nice place for waiting for a flight when you don't want to pay a lot of money withing Moscow. I crossed both Russian and Armenian borders very well. I didn't have any problems. However an officer on Armenian border had doubts about Ksushas passport. The problem is that some of them don't know that Russian could have two foreign passports. It's not a new practice but it's still rare situation. I made two passports in order to be able to send of one to an embassy and travel using second one. Luckily it was not a problem and she crossed the border as well. After that we reached home and ordered sushi. After that I went to supermarket and bought goods for breakfast. I really feel like I came home. It's nice. I missed Saint-Petersburg very much but now I realized that don't live there anymore. Surely it's painful. 

Also I need to add couple of sentences about yesterday's road from Moscow to Rzhev. We bought tickets for bus that drove us to Moscow for four hours. The road was nice. After that we spent another hour in taxi and checked into hotel.

Additionally I felt really bad in a plane today. The air pressure changes significantly plus runny nose bothered me. Finally I experienced huge pain in my eyes. It was so horrible. Hopefully I had some painkillers that helped me. I need to start doing sport again. I feel how It became hard for me to live in this body.

# 06 October - Friday - Yerevan - 372 day of immigration

I still feel bad. This cold is annoying me, but Friday makes me happy. Today I finished a lot of tasks. Despite of my condition I was productive. I am happy about that because yesterday I though that I would die. I felt so bad in airplane. In general, I groomed my github a bit and found several candidates for portfolio. Additionally I created a monorepo that I will use for xu preparations. I need to recall some principles of working in this setup. Especially how to organize deploy and other things. Unfortunately I also have to recall how Angular works. I gradually migrating to Reactjs but XU works with Angular. Also I need to recall how to work with Nestjs. A lot of things should be done. All this shit is important. I need to work well and then leave the company. MY reputation is the most important thing here.

# 07 October - Saturday - Yerevan - 373 day of immigration

Today I didn't feel well again. My illness is still going on. I wish to be better tomorrow. however I found some energy for working on my article today. Also me and Ksusha prepared a schedule for German lessons. We are going to start learning this language from the next week. I'll do it actually from monday. I will learn German every Monday and Thursday. Wednesday I reserved for Spanish. I want to keep this knowledge somehow in normal condition. It's very high probability that I will use duolinguo for keeping english in normal condition and for training other languages as well. Why I mentioned it? Because I also need to dive deeper to English. It's another huge problem for me that I am not so cool in it as well. I can speak, I can write but I can't perform in front of an audience with this level of English. Another event today is our visit to Hard Rock cafe. I really enjoy this place. I like to be there, order burgers and bear. Unfortunately today I had to avoid alcohol due to my illness. Another interesting thing that happened today is Palestine attack to Israel. I think that victims will destroy muslims fanatics. I cannot be tolerant in this situation because I hate all sorts of fanatics and all sorts of propaganda.

# 08 October - Sunday - Yerevan - 374 day of immigration

The classic Sunday has been finished. I did a lot of programming things and spent a lot of time with Ksusha. Kushas's mother presented 100 dollars to me and Ksusha for our birthdays. So, Today we were in cosmetic shops and was looking for some cool things for Ksusha. I ordered apple pencil on Wildberries. In 20 days it will be here. I hope that this thing will be useful for me. I will see. About illness. I feel much better today. Maybe I will be ok until the middle of the next week. Tomorrow I am going to start learning German systematically. It's important because I have only 22 months minus time for checking my exam results for obtaining b1 level of this language. It'll be hard because I don't have motivation for learning it. I like Spanish and English not German. However I think that knowing German is necessary. I want to be able speaking German, English, and Spanish until my 40th. I suppose it will be cool collection. If I have time I maybe start learning French and Ukrainian. In general this sunday was nice.

# 09 October - Monday - Yerevan - 375 day of immigration

Today I was working hard on Backend topics. I am going to have an interview tomorrow with one of companies. I have no clue what I will have there but maybe something good will happen. Additionally I was coding and fighting with graphql. I need to understand how to set up it on the backend side. The main thing for today is that I had the first German lesson in the morning. It was nice but quite useless because I know almost everything I heard on that videos. However I know that something interesting will start soon. Additional cool thing is tha the course price is 3 dollars for me. 1.5 dollars for me and Ksusha. I like this kind of things. In general the day was nice I am tiered and want to have a rest. I will do it just after finishing writing this lines. Sometimes I think that this diary is the most boring thing is this universe.

# 10 October - Tuesday - Yerevan - 376 day of immigration

Unfortunately I still feel bad. This illness cannot leave me alone. However I was able to work today. I finished with some tasks and had an interview with some company. I don't think that I was excellent. Probably not. However I enjoyed this call. I know that I need to start working more on my technical expertise. I realized that if you want to be a technical manager you have to know more about backend. I will focus my attention on it in nearest future. I will do something on nextjs but and the same time using some full backend frameworks. My neck is better today but still hurts. I forgot to mention yesterday that DS finally sent my salary. It was hard to force them doing it. Fucking morons. Tomorrow I will have the first normal spanish lesson where I need to learn actual material and not to just sitting without any goal. It will be interesting because I even forgot to by a notebook for it. If I wake up in time I will biy it in a supermarket. The cool thing about Armenians supermarkets that you can buy everything there including pan, pen, notebooks, toilet paper, cheese, beer, vodka, tables for dishwasher machine, etc. It's very Russian conception.

# 11 October - Wednesday - Yerevan - 377 day of immigration

Fucking shit, I still feel bad. I hate it. However tasks are still with me and I have to do them. Today I was trying to understand things about Graphql. I thing that I understand some basics and it's nice. Additionally I started working on actual book. It's also cool. In the first part of the day I had a Spanish lesson. I decided to proceed learning it despite the shift of my focus to German. It's big and important thing. Also I feel how more time I have now for my own tasks. Absence of leading tasks make me happier. It's like to be on vacation. It's incredible. Very shortly we are going to walk with Ksusha. The weather is relatively fine and we didn't go out yesterday. MAybe I will write some lines after this, but I am not sure.

# 12 October - Thursday - Yerevan - 378 day of immigration

Today I did a lot of things. I suppose it's the most favorite phrase in this diary. However, I understood some stuff from GraphQL things. It was hard and unusual. At the same time it's necessary to have this backend crush course for me. I still think a lot about my future. I see myself as CTO. It's my goal. I still believe that I can do it in Berlin or Germany in general. At the same time I am a bit nervous about my working visa. It's in processing now but I hope to take it soon. I don't know if they give me a blue card. I still have a hope to get it. another thing about this day - I feel much better. I hope to be ok on this weekend. In the morning I had a German lesson. I realized that I need more time for homework. I will do it tomorrow morning. I need to finish an abstract and train pronunciation. I mentioned before that I read a book about German history. It's pretty interesting I can say. It's something very informative. At least I will have some highlight knowledge about the topic. I think that Germany has a very big change to become my new motherland. I am 35 years old and I need to have home. Before that I thought a lot about USA and I still do it but I don't have time. MAybe I am wrong and I will get some opportunity in the future with relocation to the USA. I am not Oracle, The future is unpredictable. Who knows what will be with me. Maybe I will get a stroke and die tomorrow.

# 13 October - Friday - Yerevan - 379 day of immigration

So, I finally understood how to resolve some queries to graphql. It's really cool and nice. I've been doing some preparations fo XU company. If everything is ok with visa I will start working with backend soon. Initially I was sceptic about it but I still found some advantages in the situation working as fullstack. If I want to pass an interview for managerial position I need to learn some system design things. So, some cons are exists here. I also today did some another important things. I included German homework for instance. I really like to learn foreign languages. Also I feel much better today. I really want to do yoga this weekend. Running nose situation is almost resolved and I am happy about it. In general this day was nice and long. It's 18.44 o'clock and I am completely tiered. The book about german history is waiting for me. I'll go to it right know. Before that it's expected to have a dinner. Delivery guy is probably nearby.

# 14 October - Saturday - Yerevan - 380 day of immigration

As you know Saturday is a cheat meal day. Only then I eat bread, sweets, and drink soda, and coffee. The first reason is that I don't want to be fat the second one is that bread is bad for teeth, and the third one is that I don't want to have diabetes. The sugar control is crucial. Also it helps me to be relatively fit despite the absence of sport in my life. However I feel that some muscles are degraded. For example, the back muscles in the area of the shoulder blades are almost absent. When I twist my shoulder I hear a crunching sound in my back. It means that I have to start doing sport again. Tomorrow will be the first time after long break. I'm 35 years old and I feel that my body is not so healthy and cool like it was 15 years ago. Everything changes and I become older every day. This is sad to admit but it's true. Also I finally want to finish editing of Barcelona video. I will do it tomorrow. After that I can proceed shooting another episodes. It was long break and after becoming of senior engineer again I have much more time for everything else. For example I dedicate hours to learning new stuff and reading books. It's like I am on vacation after all stress I experienced before. I don't think that DR SMILE sink down after my leaving but I carry all knowledge with me. Of course, I still need to analyze all the experience that I got. It will be a good source for future articles. I am really happy about that. For better or worse, my DR SMILE story is quite close to its end. Sad but true.

# 15 October - Sunday - Yerevan - 381 day of immigration

So, today I cleaned my apartment and did some other usual things. The best activity today was continuing to edit the Barcelona video. It looks like I'll finish it soon. Also, I updated my article that I'm working on. I even tried to copy some lines to Hacker Noon. I am going to publish it there, and I'm also very close to finishing my work on it. Me and Ksusha also were walking using new route. It was nice. Yesterday we were walking in local Victory park, Finally I took some photos of Mother Armenia monument. Also yesterday was a Yerevan birthday. Some balloons were flying above in the sky. It was nice and beautiful. Another cool thing about Armenia is the weather. It's always cool. It's much better that in Saint-P. I heard that yesterday it was raining horizontally. Another amazing thing for me is that today is 17 degrees. It's amazingly warm weather for me. I really like it. So, yes. Also I did german homework today and some other minor things.

# 16 October - Monday - Yerevan - 382 day of immigration

Today was a really hard and stressful day. Ksushas sister got pregnant recently but today she miscarried. It's really hard thing to carry. I hope she will be ok soon. It was quite short pregnancy, for about a month. Anyway it is bas and scary. We will get some news from her side today I suppose. I don't know what is happening right now. From another side I got apple pencil today. It's surprisingly useful thing in my case. It is much better that moleskin or something like this. I believe that I will almost stop using paper for daily notes. It's ok to be without this stuff. Another piece of news I run from home to cafe for work today. I feel bad emotionally and I decided to leave home in order not to argue to Ksusha. I usually don't do anything like this but today my patience blew up. Sometimes I cannot carry emotional things. However I did everything according my todo list and this is good. Also I am tiered of waiting for a working visa. This wait is also destroy my nerves. It's hard. I know that they can thing fo several weeks but still. It's hard. I want to leave this place asap. I feel like my life leaking to some void.

# 17 October - Tuesday - Yerevan - 383 day of immigration

This day was quite pleasant. I did a lot of things. I was working on my article, holy theory project, some additional features for future articles, and more. I really enjoy such calm days. After stealing of my leading responsibilities I feel sadder but more free. They are very polar things. However I am glad that it happened at the end of my work for them. I try to find pros, not only cons. At the same time I still been waiting for a visa. I hope to get in soon. Sometimes I think to leave everything as is and move to america. It's some romantic bullshit. I know that I would be extremely hard. It's not a piece of cake. It's big stuff. Oh, I've just recalled. I edited my Barcelona video today a bit. I really want to finish doing it as soon as possible. I set a deadline at the end of this week. The weather in Yerevan became worse. It rained yesterday. I didn't enjoy a walk. About yesterday's situation. Ksushas sister feels good after miscarry. It's still bad a sad thing. She wanted to aborted this pregnancy though. Another yesterday point - me and Ksusha are ok. We talked to each other and fixed all misunderstanding. I really love her. We are together for such long time and I cannot imagine how I would be without her.

# 18 October - Wednesday - Yerevan - 384 day of immigration

Today I woke up because of disgusting smell from fucking pipes in this apartments. The place that I rent is quite nice but everything is related to pipes and sewerage is absolutely awful. Besides the smell some flies live there and fly out from drainage holes in the floor. It's disgusting. However I studied german this morning and going to do it tomorrow. Unfortunately I have to cancel Spanish lessons. I just don't have time for them. I am really destructed because of it. I like Spanish much more that German, but I have to do it. Also I spent a lot of time with Clerk solution. It's third party auth provider. I got the main principles of it and finished with front-end implementation. I also updates holy theory project. Additionally I had a call with some company that published engineering position in August and I applied it but got and invitation only on Friday. They are really slow. Now I am going to have a dinner and after that I will go for a walk of read a book.

# 19 October - Thursday - Yerevan - 385 day of immigration

The good news have come. Both mine and Ksusha's passports were sent to courier agency. I suppose that we will know something interesting about our visas soon.
