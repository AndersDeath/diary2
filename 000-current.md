# 01 May - Monday - Barcelona - 214 day of immigration

Today we were in the park that was in Parfumer movie. There is a labyrinth there. It's quite nice place and I was surprised. we also were at plau de la musica which is one of the first modernizm buildings in Barcelona. The rest of the day we spent at home. I also definitely have to proceed with sport and meditation. I also was coding with pleasure today. It's quite rare situation. I also finally finished with Holy Theory metadata adding. It's cool. The documentation for holy theory generator is also finished. It will be a short and simple javascript program which helps to prepare data for eleventy and just simple readme file. I will come back to walking. I went to Barcelona's beach and had a nice time there. Ksusha stayed at home and I was there alone. Anyway it was a pleasure. I was listening to techno and other music.

# 02 May - Tuesday - Barcelona - 215 day of immigration

This day was a good. We didn't walk a lot and I am not so tiered. I can say the same about Ksusha. I had an interview with Happeo guy. It was nice and short. I also did sport and meditation that is amazing because for the last several weeks I didn't have power to do it. I decided now that I have one sacred hour for my body every day. I need to change my body shape. I think that it is a time. I am 35 years old and my body and health will never be better but only worse. So, it's my goal. In general I finished with almost all tasks from my list. Also I started enjoying Barcelona.  Initially my impression wasn't so good, but now everything is ok and I can say that my opinion changed in some ways. I want to listen to source video about this city shortly and then decide if I need to record some another part for some reasons.

# 03 May - Wednesday - Barcelona - 216 day of immigration

So, I am sitting in Buenos Migas place which is one of the places where it is possible to eat for affordable price in this city. I tried to rerecord my video about Barcelona this morning but I got only piece of shit. Local streets are extremely noisy and I didn't find a place where I can be in calm env. I also changed a plan for the video. Now it has strong structure that I want to try the next morning. From another side this day was quite calm. The day after tomorrow in the nearest friday we are leaving this city. the first stop will be Rome, that Dortmund. After that we are going to use douchebahn and enter to Berlin. In general this vacation is quite cool because I finally looked at Spain through key whole. In general I got good impressions about this country. MAybe it's because I like Spanish language though. Neverming I got good time. The first week was hard but now I am ok and ready to start doing new great things.

# 04 May - Thursday - Barcelona - 217 day of immigration

Today we finally to CosmoCaixa. It's a museum on science in Barcelona that was founded by loca Caixa bank. I hope I typed this title correctly. It's a cool place awith interactive things and fishes and ancient animalas. I wish to had such place when I was a kid. I also finally recorded all video sources. The latest attempt wasn't so good. Tomorrow I'm going to start editing of this stuff. We also was in Hard Rock cafe. Barcelona's version sucks. Yerevan's one is much better. We also started to look for an apartments in Yerevan for summer when I have to go there in order to finish with my teeth. Hopefully I will have the full set if them this summer. At the same time I found a bit time for studying today and worked on nuxtjs understanding.
