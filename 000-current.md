# 01 April - Montag - Berlin - 559 Tag der Einwanderung - Cold Sunny

I hate day of fool. It's always a piece of shit. However nobody pranked me and I am happy about it. At the same time I did a lot of cool things during the day. I learned some stuff and released another version of Holy Theory. On bad thing happened to me. It looks like my haemorrhoids came back to me. I need to have some relief but I don't know how. The situation is dangerous again.

# 02 April - Dienstag - Berlin - 560 Tag der Einwanderung - Cold Sunny

The same weather like yesterday. I feel worse today. We even got a couple of new termins to doctors. I hope to visit them on the next week. I hope to see them really. It looks like I am very close to surgery again. WIll see. I try to get some specific pills that can help me. I need to be on diet now that is sad but important to me. Besides that I did a lot of good things again. I was coding and did some investigation things. To be honest my illness pushed my mood down again. It's painful really. At the same time I still have an illusion that medications will help me.

# 03 April - Mittwoch - Berlin - 561 Tag der Einwanderung - Cold Sunny

The day was nice. Nothing fency happened. I still don't feel good. However I did a lot of good things and it's really cool. The day after tomorrow I will go to a doctor and get something him. I hope that my insurance will cover the visit. I really hope. I don't have money for this now. I think everything will be ok. I also have a termin to proctologist and it's  good.

# 04 April - Dienstag - Berlin - 562 Tag der Einwanderung - Cold Sunny

Today I also feel ok. Surely I cannot postpone the visit to doctor. It's cool that I am going to him tomorrow morning. I found all papers I received last time when I had surgery. I am sure that It will help me tomorrow. I also need to be in schedule again. I am not so motivated to work in XU. The stopping working with the Polish team hit me very much. I could not expect this. Currently I need to change my behavior's strategy. Besides that I just was in the bed for a hole day. I could do much due to pain. I drink pills and other medication but for me even sitting is uncomfortable now. I hate this illness. Vein system is my weak point. After treatment that I suppose to get tomorrow I will do much more sport. I really don't want to have this again. It's so bad.

I was in the doctor office today. He gave me a paper for proctologist quite easy and quickly. Here in Germany it's impossible going to such doctors without approval from a therapist. So yea. I got everything nad it's nice. The bad think that a termin to tsurgeon is in 10 day. I need to wait for it and eat medications. It's sad because I don't want to destroy my liver and kidneys. But I have no choise. Additionally I was in Barbershop and a woman did haircut fom me. I think that I didn't do haircut by barber-woman for the last 5 years I believe. This barberin did hair very well. Tomorrow we are going to meet Gammel family that is really cool. So, in general the day was nice.

# 06 April - Samstag - Berlin - 564 Tag der Einwanderung - Warm Sunny

The day ws nice. We were in Garder of the World in Eastern Berlin. We walked there with Gammel family and they showed us this place. It's a really cool garden with themed to different cultures corners. We were walking, talking, having fun. After that we ate in Ikea and visited Uniqlo because I needed to buy some stuff there. Also I payed for CT finally and exchanged 300 dollars we had as a reserve. It's was nice. We were so tired that the only thing we could do at home - sleep. In genera the day was really nice. I enjoyed it very much. I would like to repeat this.

# 07 April - Sontag - Berlin - 565 Tag der Einwanderung - Warm Sunny

Today we finally cleaned up our aoartments and did some other typicall activities. The summer came to Berlin, the weather is so cool. We had a lunch on outside table in one of local restaraunts. It's was really nice. Warm Berlin is really cool and enjoyable. I like it very very much. Surely the fact that we came to the place in the middle of the Winter played its bad role. We wasn't happy of the place, but now everything feels much better. Another thing is that I had a German lesson this morning. It sucks that I need to memorize a lot of things. I don't like it at all, but I need to have b1 certificate for getting permanent residency. It's my real plan that I need to accomplish somehow. I will do my best for it.

# 08 April - Montag - Berlin - 566 Tag der Einwanderung - Warm Sunny

The summer has come. The weather is awesome. Being on the street is even better than in the room. This really helps to be in normal conditions. I feel normal, my hemorrhoids doesn't pain. It's good. In one week I will visit a doctor that is really cool and I am waiting for it really hard. I expect some surgery after this visit, but I cannot say when it might happen. I hope that it will be not so annoying and painful. However, I will see. Besides that I released another holy theory bunch and so on. Additionally I had an interview with one company, it was mostly cultural fit talk. I have a hope to be invited to the next step. This company has 6 interviews but if it is good I will get really nice position. For keeping myself in normal mental state I just don't think about it and try to be ready to everything but don't press my mentality. I really don't want to be crazy.

# 09 April - Dienstag - Berlin - 567 Tag der Einwanderung - Warm Sunny

The weather was so cool that I could sit on balcony and work. In general I was coding for a whole day. I finished with some things that I could concentrate my efforts. Now everything is nice. TOmorrow I am going to the office. THey asked me to do it because some potential investors are going to visit us. I am curious about it. Overall my mood is better again. I cannot say that I am absolutely ok, but anyway. Also today happened interesting thing. I was talking to a recruiter that rejected my application to some position but offered me other one that was a company that already rejected me. Sadly but it was true. At the same time this is the first such case in my life. It's funny.

# 10 April - Mittwoch - Berlin - 568 Tag der Einwanderung - Warm Sunny

I spent the whole day in the office that was nice but a little bit painful due to my illness. However I did a lot of things again. I had a call with some guy from linkedin where he asked me some questions about immigration difficulties. So, it was interesting because it was not about job. I also had an interesting talk with Paul about product manageress behavior. They don't want to listen to us for some reasons, I don't know why but it's a big problem int the company. I try to not press myself so much and just ignore this. In the evening me and Ksusha tried to visit toastmasters club but their address on the official web site was wrong and we came to the old one. I was sad about it and it was so annoying. It is another moment in Germany that I hate. It's so German to change the address and don't replace the old one on the official website.

# 11 April - Donnerstag - Berlin - 567 Tag der Einwanderung - Warm Sunny

The day was nice. I was working on fixing interesting bug in XU company. It consumed almost all my day. Additionally I tried to do a checking of a car that I am going to rest on Sunday. It was unsuccessful and I don't know why. Maybe it doesn't work with russian drive license. I will get it on Sunday in airport. Also I had a german lesson and some other minor things that are not so interesting in this context. Another thing that I started loosing my patients about DR SMILE and that they should pay me my bonus. The process in absolutely opaque and something weird happens. It looks like I need to visit them in the office and finally ask questions. It's really hight chance that I will do it this month. Additionally I received several invitations to interview that it really nice and promising.

# 12 April - Freitag - Berlin - 568 Tag der Einwanderung - Warm Sunny

The day was nice. I finished with some tasks for XU, and finished doing a bunch of improvements for my projects. In general I was at home for a whole day but in the evening me and Ksusha were in Volskpark Freidrichshine. I am not sure that wroted down this title correctly. The place was really nice and it is just in 20 minutes walking from my home. It's really cool that the place is so close to us. Also We can drive to the part on tram that is in 10 minutes walking from our place. It's really cool and I like it. Step by step we started investigating this district and I think that we found really good place for living. Surely it's a little bit more expensive than further places but it worth it.

# 13 April - Samstag - Berlin - 569 Tag der Einwanderung - Warm Sunny

The spring in Berlin is really warm. I heard that it's really unusual weather for the city. So we were today in Amerika House in the city center. We looked at two exhibitions there. The first one was dedicated to some crazy woman that liked to shoot naked photos of herself and another one about rapist and rape as a process. the second exhibition was more interesting for me. Also we baked croissants this morning that were much tastier that in local cafes. I can say that bakeries and cafes here are not so cool. The quality of them in Saint-Petersburg is much better. It's interesting.
