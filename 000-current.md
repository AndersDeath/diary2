# 01 January - Sunday - Tbilisi - 94 day of immigration

2023 has been started. I don't like to use this nice numbers for tarting doing something, but I think that 2023 is a good year for starting a new life. Surely It's not the first time when I start a new life, but being and living is not something sustainable, it's constatly changing thing. I already have a plan for those changes.
