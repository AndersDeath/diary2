# 01 September - Friday - Yerevan - 337 day of immigration

The summer has gone. I did a test task for wunderflats today. I enjoyed this coding and I can expect good result. I don't know what will be with me, but maybe everything will be cool. I would like t work for them, really. This morning my dentist did teeth cleaning for me. it was really successful because they changed color. It's amazing. Tomorrow I will go to another procedure with an another tooth. In general I was working only on test task today. Whatever the outcome, I will reshape this and add to my portfolio. The thing works fine in general and I enjoy it.


# 02 September - Saturday - Yerevan - 338 day of immigration

So, Today I was in dentist's cabinet again. Everything went well and I will probably save this tooth. Me and Ksusha also were walking a bit in the city center. The hardest thing is the weather. Today was about 35 degrees. By the way the autumn is already here. It's absolutely impossible heat for Saint-Petersburg. Despite this fact I miss home. I still do it. It's probably some pain that is impossible to fix. I would be happy to walk on Nevski avenue or on some other streets. I also miss Bugry so much,
