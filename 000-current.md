# 01 July - Saturday - Yerevan - Gyumri- 275 day of immigration

We were in Gyumri today. We bought tickets to local train in advance and used this transport. IT was nice for about 2 hours trip from Yerevan to Gyumri and the same time back. This city is quite old and had name Adrianapol and Leninakan before. This titles are from Russian empire and USSR accordingly. It is quite nice city that is absolutely perfect for one time visit. I don't think that I will go back to the place. We checked several local cafes and restaurants, visited several places of interests and had a good time. I really enjoyed this trip. I made 20000 steps today and my legs are buzzing now. It's crazy. Another nice thing is that I did a lot of duo linguo exercises in train and read several pages of Lord of the rings. I barely have time for reading and sometimes I am really happy to do it. It very relaxes me. I still believe that reading is the best way to train fantasy. You have only words and some mood. All pictures you build in mind by yourself. Yea. This day was nice. I hope that tomorrow will be at least the same. Will see.

# 02 July - Saturday - Yerevan - 276 day of immigration

I started learning fastapi today. It's python's library that help to do simple api's. I really want to learn this language despite the fact that I hated it before. Anyway I need to push my brain to think and analyze a new information. This is important. I also prepared some materials for the future test task that I need to finish withing the next two days. I will wake up much earlier because of it. The next week will be hard because I really need to do much more than usual. First of all I need to finish a lot of DR SMILE's tasks. Second of all I need to be prepared to interviews. And finally I need to increase a holy theory developing pace. Now it's silly. I am not satisfied by it.
