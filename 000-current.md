# 01 October - Sunday - Saint-Petersburg - 367 day of immigration

I met Mom and aunt Anya today. I was happy to see them. I met mother in the city center on Nevsky prospect after that I visited Anya on Chkalovskaya. She lives on Kupchinskaya street. It was meeting. I enjoyed it. After that I met Ksusha and we went to Sevkabel port. It's a cultural place on Vasilyevskiy ostrov. In general the day was nice. We finished preparation of documents. Tomorrow we will go to the visa center and at 3pm we will sit to Spsan and go to Tver. There we will met Igor and he will drive us to Rzhev. After one day there we are going to Moscow and back to Yerevan. The only concern is how I will cross the border. It's not so clear. I hope that there will be no problems. Will see. Now I am sitting in Nastya's studio and waiting for Ksusha. oh, We also were in Balagan food court. It's a nice place on Chkalovskaya with a lot of nice mini-restaurants. I was there before and I was happy to visit that place again. So, also I need to take a shower and go to sleep. I am quite tiered and would be happy to have a rest. Good day.

# 02 October - Monday - Saint-Petersburg - Rzhev - 368 day of immigration

So, My application is in visa center. We spent 2.5 hours there. It was really crazy. One hour was burned for checking my document pocket and another 40 minutes for getting fingerprints. Other minutes were burned for waiting, payments and waiting, waiting, waiting... It was hard. However we finished with it and after that we packed our luggage and arrived to Tver on Sapsan. Igor - Ksusha's mother husband met us there and drove to Rzhev. Oh, I forgot we met my mom in metro in te morning. It was just for a couple of minutes but very pleasant. I miss my mom and for others. The full tomorrow we will be here but the day after tomorrow we are going to Moscow and fly back to Yerevan. I am still worried about crossing the border. I hope everything will be ok. In general the was good. The only bad thing is that Ksusha is sick and feels bad. Maybe she will be better tomorrow.

# 03 October - Tuesday - Rzhev - 369 day of immigration

Today I was working on my portfolio a lot. The scope from DS is still unclear. I just ignore a lot of things there. Maybe today someone can give me a direction for work. I don't care anymore. Fuck them. Also ME and Ksusha were in Arabica cafe which is in the city center of Rzhev. It's nice place with average food but with great coffee. It's one of the best cafes I even been. After that we visited Ksusha's grandmother. She is 80 years old but looks good despite the cancer disease . She is in remission now. I hope everything will be ok with her. Another thing is that I got sick. I think I just got it from Ksusha because she did't feel good since we left Yerevan. She is much better now but I have all this symptoms. I hope to be ok because tomorrow we are going to Moscow and I need to recover a bit. Nevermind. I think everything will be good.

# 04 October - Wednesday - Rzhev - Moscow - 370 day of immigration

So, I am writing these lines sitting on chair in Rzhev. In 30 minutes we are going to bus and then will have a long drive to Moscow. I suppose it will be for about 4 hours including traffic. It's impossible to avoid this problem sadly. We will sleep at hotel in Domodedovo airport and tomorrow's morning flying to Yerevan. I hope that it will not be a problem with crossing the border. I sill have a hope. At the same time our document are already in German embassy in Moscow. If everything is good we will get an answer soon. After that we need a wait a bit for Ksusha's visa and then we are ready to go. I still think a lot about Germany. As I mentioned before It will be another step in our lives. I don't know how Ksusha will adapt her deals and business there but I am sure that I will help her. At the same time I got funny story from my our owners of apartments. I will copy the story from watsup soon. It's really interesting.

# 05 October - Thursday - Moscow - Yerevan- 371 day of immigration

I woke in Maxima hotel at Domodedovo airport. It's quite nice place for waiting for a flight when you don't want to pay a lot of money withing Moscow. I crossed both Russian and Armenian borders very well. I didn't have any problems. However an officer on Armenian border had doubts about Ksushas passport. The problem is that some of them don't know that Russian could have two foreign passports. It's not a new practice but it's still rare situation. I made two passports in order to be able to send of one to an embassy and travel using second one. Luckily it was not a problem and she crossed the border as well. After that we reached home and ordered sushi. After that I went to supermarket and bought goods for breakfast. I really feel like I came home. It's nice. I missed Saint-Petersburg very much but now I realized that don't live there anymore. Surely it's painful.

Also I need to add couple of sentences about yesterday's road from Moscow to Rzhev. We bought tickets for bus that drove us to Moscow for four hours. The road was nice. After that we spent another hour in taxi and checked into hotel.

Additionally I felt really bad in a plane today. The air pressure changes significantly plus runny nose bothered me. Finally I experienced huge pain in my eyes. It was so horrible. Hopefully I had some painkillers that helped me. I need to start doing sport again. I feel how It became hard for me to live in this body.

# 06 October - Friday - Yerevan - 372 day of immigration

I still feel bad. This cold is annoying me, but Friday makes me happy. Today I finished a lot of tasks. Despite of my condition I was productive. I am happy about that because yesterday I though that I would die. I felt so bad in airplane. In general, I groomed my github a bit and found several candidates for portfolio. Additionally I created a monorepo that I will use for xu preparations. I need to recall some principles of working in this setup. Especially how to organize deploy and other things. Unfortunately I also have to recall how Angular works. I gradually migrating to Reactjs but XU works with Angular. Also I need to recall how to work with Nestjs. A lot of things should be done. All this shit is important. I need to work well and then leave the company. MY reputation is the most important thing here.

# 07 October - Saturday - Yerevan - 373 day of immigration

Today I didn't feel well again. My illness is still going on. I wish to be better tomorrow. however I found some energy for working on my article today. Also me and Ksusha prepared a schedule for German lessons. We are going to start learning this language from the next week. I'll do it actually from monday. I will learn German every Monday and Thursday. Wednesday I reserved for Spanish. I want to keep this knowledge somehow in normal condition. It's very high probability that I will use duolinguo for keeping english in normal condition and for training other languages as well. Why I mentioned it? Because I also need to dive deeper to English. It's another huge problem for me that I am not so cool in it as well. I can speak, I can write but I can't perform in front of an audience with this level of English. Another event today is our visit to Hard Rock cafe. I really enjoy this place. I like to be there, order burgers and bear. Unfortunately today I had to avoid alcohol due to my illness. Another interesting thing that happened today is Palestine attack to Israel. I think that victims will destroy muslims fanatics. I cannot be tolerant in this situation because I hate all sorts of fanatics and all sorts of propaganda.

# 08 October - Sunday - Yerevan - 374 day of immigration

The classic Sunday has been finished. I did a lot of programming things and spent a lot of time with Ksusha. Kushas's mother presented 100 dollars to me and Ksusha for our birthdays. So, Today we were in cosmetic shops and was looking for some cool things for Ksusha. I ordered apple pencil on Wildberries. In 20 days it will be here. I hope that this thing will be useful for me. I will see. About illness. I feel much better today. Maybe I will be ok until the middle of the next week. Tomorrow I am going to start learning German systematically. It's important because I have only 22 months minus time for checking my exam results for obtaining b1 level of this language. It'll be hard because I don't have motivation for learning it. I like Spanish and English not German. However I think that knowing German is necessary. I want to be able speaking German, English, and Spanish until my 40th. I suppose it will be cool collection. If I have time I maybe start learning French and Ukrainian. In general this sunday was nice.

# 09 October - Monday - Yerevan - 375 day of immigration

Today I was working hard on Backend topics. I am going to have an interview tomorrow with one of companies. I have no clue what I will have there but maybe something good will happen. Additionally I was coding and fighting with graphql. I need to understand how to set up it on the backend side. The main thing for today is that I had the first German lesson in the morning. It was nice but quite useless because I know almost everything I heard on that videos. However I know that something interesting will start soon. Additional cool thing is tha the course price is 3 dollars for me. 1.5 dollars for me and Ksusha. I like this kind of things. In general the day was nice I am tiered and want to have a rest. I will do it just after finishing writing this lines. Sometimes I think that this diary is the most boring thing is this universe.

# 10 October - Tuesday - Yerevan - 376 day of immigration

Unfortunately I still feel bad. This illness cannot leave me alone. However I was able to work today. I finished with some tasks and had an interview with some company. I don't think that I was excellent. Probably not. However I enjoyed this call. I know that I need to start working more on my technical expertise. I realized that if you want to be a technical manager you have to know more about backend. I will focus my attention on it in nearest future. I will do something on nextjs but and the same time using some full backend frameworks. My neck is better today but still hurts. I forgot to mention yesterday that DS finally sent my salary. It was hard to force them doing it. Fucking morons. Tomorrow I will have the first normal spanish lesson where I need to learn actual material and not to just sitting without any goal. It will be interesting because I even forgot to by a notebook for it. If I wake up in time I will biy it in a supermarket. The cool thing about Armenians supermarkets that you can buy everything there including pan, pen, notebooks, toilet paper, cheese, beer, vodka, tables for dishwasher machine, etc. It's very Russian conception.

# 11 October - Wednesday - Yerevan - 377 day of immigration

Fucking shit, I still feel bad. I hate it. However tasks are still with me and I have to do them. Today I was trying to understand things about Graphql. I thing that I understand some basics and it's nice. Additionally I started working on actual book. It's also cool. In the first part of the day I had a Spanish lesson. I decided to proceed learning it despite the shift of my focus to German. It's big and important thing. Also I feel how more time I have now for my own tasks. Absence of leading tasks make me happier. It's like to be on vacation. It's incredible. Very shortly we are going to walk with Ksusha. The weather is relatively fine and we didn't go out yesterday. MAybe I will write some lines after this, but I am not sure.

# 12 October - Thursday - Yerevan - 378 day of immigration

Today I did a lot of things. I suppose it's the most favorite phrase in this diary. However, I understood some stuff from GraphQL things. It was hard and unusual. At the same time it's necessary to have this backend crush course for me. I still think a lot about my future. I see myself as CTO. It's my goal. I still believe that I can do it in Berlin or Germany in general. At the same time I am a bit nervous about my working visa. It's in processing now but I hope to take it soon. I don't know if they give me a blue card. I still have a hope to get it. another thing about this day - I feel much better. I hope to be ok on this weekend. In the morning I had a German lesson. I realized that I need more time for homework. I will do it tomorrow morning. I need to finish an abstract and train pronunciation. I mentioned before that I read a book about German history. It's pretty interesting I can say. It's something very informative. At least I will have some highlight knowledge about the topic. I think that Germany has a very big change to become my new motherland. I am 35 years old and I need to have home. Before that I thought a lot about USA and I still do it but I don't have time. MAybe I am wrong and I will get some opportunity in the future with relocation to the USA. I am not Oracle, The future is unpredictable. Who knows what will be with me. Maybe I will get a stroke and die tomorrow.

# 13 October - Friday - Yerevan - 379 day of immigration

So, I finally understood how to resolve some queries to graphql. It's really cool and nice. I've been doing some preparations fo XU company. If everything is ok with visa I will start working with backend soon. Initially I was sceptic about it but I still found some advantages in the situation working as fullstack. If I want to pass an interview for managerial position I need to learn some system design things. So, some cons are exists here. I also today did some another important things. I included German homework for instance. I really like to learn foreign languages. Also I feel much better today. I really want to do yoga this weekend. Running nose situation is almost resolved and I am happy about it. In general this day was nice and long. It's 18.44 o'clock and I am completely tiered. The book about german history is waiting for me. I'll go to it right know. Before that it's expected to have a dinner. Delivery guy is probably nearby.

# 14 October - Saturday - Yerevan - 380 day of immigration

As you know Saturday is a cheat meal day. Only then I eat bread, sweets, and drink soda, and coffee. The first reason is that I don't want to be fat the second one is that bread is bad for teeth, and the third one is that I don't want to have diabetes. The sugar control is crucial. Also it helps me to be relatively fit despite the absence of sport in my life. However I feel that some muscles are degraded. For example, the back muscles in the area of the shoulder blades are almost absent. When I twist my shoulder I hear a crunching sound in my back. It means that I have to start doing sport again. Tomorrow will be the first time after long break. I'm 35 years old and I feel that my body is not so healthy and cool like it was 15 years ago. Everything changes and I become older every day. This is sad to admit but it's true. Also I finally want to finish editing of Barcelona video. I will do it tomorrow. After that I can proceed shooting another episodes. It was long break and after becoming of senior engineer again I have much more time for everything else. For example I dedicate hours to learning new stuff and reading books. It's like I am on vacation after all stress I experienced before. I don't think that DR SMILE sink down after my leaving but I carry all knowledge with me. Of course, I still need to analyze all the experience that I got. It will be a good source for future articles. I am really happy about that. For better or worse, my DR SMILE story is quite close to its end. Sad but true.

# 15 October - Sunday - Yerevan - 381 day of immigration

So, today I cleaned my apartment and did some other usual things. The best activity today was continuing to edit the Barcelona video. It looks like I'll finish it soon. Also, I updated my article that I'm working on. I even tried to copy some lines to Hacker Noon. I am going to publish it there, and I'm also very close to finishing my work on it. Me and Ksusha also were walking using new route. It was nice. Yesterday we were walking in local Victory park, Finally I took some photos of Mother Armenia monument. Also yesterday was a Yerevan birthday. Some balloons were flying above in the sky. It was nice and beautiful. Another cool thing about Armenia is the weather. It's always cool. It's much better that in Saint-P. I heard that yesterday it was raining horizontally. Another amazing thing for me is that today is 17 degrees. It's amazingly warm weather for me. I really like it. So, yes. Also I did german homework today and some other minor things.

# 16 October - Monday - Yerevan - 382 day of immigration

Today was a really hard and stressful day. Ksushas sister got pregnant recently but today she miscarried. It's really hard thing to carry. I hope she will be ok soon. It was quite short pregnancy, for about a month. Anyway it is bas and scary. We will get some news from her side today I suppose. I don't know what is happening right now. From another side I got apple pencil today. It's surprisingly useful thing in my case. It is much better that moleskin or something like this. I believe that I will almost stop using paper for daily notes. It's ok to be without this stuff. Another piece of news I run from home to cafe for work today. I feel bad emotionally and I decided to leave home in order not to argue to Ksusha. I usually don't do anything like this but today my patience blew up. Sometimes I cannot carry emotional things. However I did everything according my todo list and this is good. Also I am tiered of waiting for a working visa. This wait is also destroy my nerves. It's hard. I know that they can thing fo several weeks but still. It's hard. I want to leave this place asap. I feel like my life leaking to some void.

# 17 October - Tuesday - Yerevan - 383 day of immigration

This day was quite pleasant. I did a lot of things. I was working on my article, holy theory project, some additional features for future articles, and more. I really enjoy such calm days. After stealing of my leading responsibilities I feel sadder but more free. They are very polar things. However I am glad that it happened at the end of my work for them. I try to find pros, not only cons. At the same time I still been waiting for a visa. I hope to get in soon. Sometimes I think to leave everything as is and move to america. It's some romantic bullshit. I know that I would be extremely hard. It's not a piece of cake. It's big stuff. Oh, I've just recalled. I edited my Barcelona video today a bit. I really want to finish doing it as soon as possible. I set a deadline at the end of this week. The weather in Yerevan became worse. It rained yesterday. I didn't enjoy a walk. About yesterday's situation. Ksushas sister feels good after miscarry. It's still bad a sad thing. She wanted to aborted this pregnancy though. Another yesterday point - me and Ksusha are ok. We talked to each other and fixed all misunderstanding. I really love her. We are together for such long time and I cannot imagine how I would be without her.

# 18 October - Wednesday - Yerevan - 384 day of immigration

Today I woke up because of disgusting smell from fucking pipes in this apartments. The place that I rent is quite nice but everything is related to pipes and sewerage is absolutely awful. Besides the smell some flies live there and fly out from drainage holes in the floor. It's disgusting. However I studied german this morning and going to do it tomorrow. Unfortunately I have to cancel Spanish lessons. I just don't have time for them. I am really destructed because of it. I like Spanish much more that German, but I have to do it. Also I spent a lot of time with Clerk solution. It's third party auth provider. I got the main principles of it and finished with front-end implementation. I also updates holy theory project. Additionally I had a call with some company that published engineering position in August and I applied it but got and invitation only on Friday. They are really slow. Now I am going to have a dinner and after that I will go for a walk of read a book.

# 19 October - Thursday - Yerevan - 385 day of immigration

The good news have come. Both mine and Ksusha's passports were sent to courier agency. I suppose that we will know something interesting about our visas soon. I really hope that they didn't reject us. In other case it will be harmful and painful for us. I will not go to Berlin without Ksusha. This is crucial thing. Besides that I visited podologist today. She freezed my heel again. The left foot is ok but right one needs to be treated. I hope that it was the last time. Today's procedure was really painful. I cannot normally walk. The rest part of the day I was working on usual tasks. It was nice and cool. I updated holy theory, understood how to use clerk from auth side, and was working on my article a bit. Also I was doing some German things today. The weather is Yerevan today is very similar to Saint-Petersburg one. It rains for a whole day. It's really unusual. I think that it's the first total raining day in this year here. The place is pretty dry and rain is quite rare event here. Oh, it makes me sad because I really miss home. Additionally I see shitty news from Russia that sound horrible. I am almost sure that they are going to close borders after the president election in the next year.

# 20 October - Friday - Yerevan - 386 day of immigration

It's Friday. I am happy to have it. I am exhausted. this week was really hard. Today I was working on graphql setup again. Everything looks fine and probably the work on this stuff will be done soon. It's not the first time when I work with this technologies but still. It's important. Our passports with some visas, I hope, were gave to courier. I suppose Nastya gets them next week and then to send them us. I am really curious if they gave me blue card. In worse case they gave me just IT work visa that I can convert to blue card in Berlin after 1st of november. Additionally I was doing some German homework. I rescheduled everything I have in my plans. I will do sport twice a week but everyday I am going to do some simple warming for my back. I feel that my body is not so cool. It's really scary what I would have at 50 if I don't do sport. Besides that ME and Ksusha rented an apartments in the city center in order to just change environment and have a rest for a while. It's a house in the heart of Yerevan. We lived nearby last year. In general I really feel that I am going to leave this place soon. Berlin is absolutely unimaginable place for me. I could only dream about living there. I hope that visas will be or and we will relocate there normally. Another this is that both mine and Ksushas passports were processed at the same moment. It's impressive. I hope that she got the visa as well. I don't know what to expect from foreign embassies but I hope that they are ok and understand me as normal person.I really hope that all is good. If I got blue card it means that in 3 years I can get a permanent residency that can open me much more things. After that I can ask for a citizenship. After this point I can be in every place in this damn world. It's impossible to have with Russian passport but absolutely available with German one.

# 21 October - Saturday - Yerevan - 387 day of immigration

So, This day was filled by doing nothing. I woke up in the morning, walked to a cafe and bought breakfast. After this I visited my barber, I suppose for the last time because in one months I will be in Berlin. The track number of our passports was updated. It looks like I will receive documents soon. It's really cool and unusual. I am about to change my life. Additionally I tool a photo for a green card lottery. Ksusha helped me and sent an application. After lunch we checked new exhibition in local art museum. I was there once but the building is extremely interesting and unusual. It a great example of soviet modernism. Also we walked around the city center and had fun. I also found some time for doing german. Tomorrow I need to finish all homeworks and barcelona video. This is my plan for sunday. I hope to do it without problems. My heel still pains. My podologis freezed it very well last time. It was harsh. I hope that last operation healed me. Additionally I got an agreement with my dentist surgeon that I will visit him next tuesday. I need to understand the next steps of my teeth treatment. I did a lot for it but still a lot of things should be done. I am not happy about it because it is so annoying to do all this surgery and stuff. It's also quite expensive. Maybe I will find some doctor in Europe, who knows. I will see.

# 22 October - Sunday - Yerevan - 388 day of immigration

The weekend has been finished. I am sad. These two days were really cool and nice. We walked a lot, ate tasty food, and almost did nothing. Today we went back from the city center to our apartments. The weather is colder in the night now. I had to turn on heating system. It's expensive for sure, but I'm ready to pay. Surprisingly the weather in Yerevan is similar to Berlin's one. It's really cool and big surprise for me. By the way the fist snow came to Saint-Petersburg and Moscow today. So, I am happy that I am far from those places. I appreciate the local climate for the opportunity to wear vans sneakers at 22 of october. Another interesting thing is that it's very close for me for leaving DR SMILE. I expect to check what kind of stuff we have in our passports in the beginning of the next week. I hope that Nasya will be able to get our documents. The situation force me to be honest with you guys, I am scary and I don't believe that German authorities can give me Blue card. At the same time I really want to have it. If something goes wrong it will hit me very much. Also if Germany gives me blue card it means that they admit my experience and I don't need to poof my expertise for myself anymore. I can start thinking of taking some other courses or try myself i getting some general education. I still have a dream to get university degree. I need to close this gestalt. Another facts of this day. ME and Ksusha went to SAS food court that is close to our previous apartments on Shinararnery street. It was nice place and we spent good times there. Sometimes I miss that place despite the absence of place there. The apartments were very small but cozy.

# 23 October - Monday - Yerevan - 389 day of immigration

Well, I got visa. Unfortunately it's not a blue card. It's just standard working visa. It means that I should go to local office after november and ask fo blue card. It also means that a lot of other people will be there and some queue will fuck me. Anyway. It's a good result. The most important thing is that Ksusha also got visa for a year. It's amazing. We will go there together. I am really happy about that. Dreams come true. This lines I'm writing in the evening. So, everything is nice. The day is almost over. I did everything according my plan. Me and Ksusha was looking for an apartments in Berlin and it's crazy. It's really expensive and painful. 1400 euro per month if I rent by daily price. It's extremely expensive but after this I want to find something cheaper. I have no clue if it's hard but I have to try. It's obvious that I don't want to live on the street. In general this day was good. I did a lot of things and got really good news about visa. I am about to immigrate to Berlin. This is interesting.

# 24 October - Tuesday - Yerevan - 390 day of immigration

So, Today I was working of whole day. I was fighting to Graphql and other problems. In the morning I met my Surgeon and everything looks good I am going to an operation next monday. I suppose it will be the last prosthetic surgery. I don't feel nice about it in general but I have to do it. Also we were looking for an apartments in Berlin today. It's not easy thing honestly. It's something crazy. You cannot just rent a place, you have to wait for a confirmation and have other potential risks. However I need to find the place for a living. I will do it I have do doubts. Germany is a nice place for starting a new life. MAybe not a "new" I don't like this definition because each life is unique and there is not any ways to split it. This figure of speak annoys me. So stupid. So, germany is nice for proceeding the career and looking for new possibilities in life. I will definitely try to squeeze everything from the place.

# 25 October - Wednesday - Yerevan - 391 day of immigration

This day was nice. We found apartments. It will be quite expensive 1500 euros per months. It's really crazy. From other side I didn't do anything significant today. I fixed some issues for DR SMILE and added some new features in holy theory. Additionally I updated my graphql clark setup which is also cool. We are going to have a dinner now. We will go to SAS. It's not so close place to us but I will be happy to walk a bit. So, the main thing for today is that we got apartments. It's crazy and really cool. Ironically I will live not so far from DR SMILE office. Also I looked at map and it's looks that I will spend 40 minutes for driving to office. Well. It's cool.

# 26 October - Thursday - Yerevan - 392 day of immigration

This day was nice. I was coding for whole day and also prepared some things for the future. I want to start some hobby for a quite long time. Maybe I will try skateboarding after migration to Germany. I understand that I am 35 years old but there is no good time for starting doing it. I decide that maybe longboard will be nice choice for be because I think a lot about sup boarding and surfing in general. I don't want to do some tricks, I just want to ride. So, Unfortunately winter is not a good time for starting doing it but still, I will start investigating it and then in March I will maybe buy something for it. Also tomorrow is the last day before my vacation. I will be happy to doing nothing for DR SMILE for a week and then start transition. I am going to tell them about my leaving just after the next week. I don't think that I will be a piece of news for them. I don't like this job anymore. I don't like it really. I would like to just forget about them for some period of time. I burned out of this company. I have no clue if XU is nice but anyway I don't have plans for being with them for a long period of time.

# 27 October - Friday - Yerevan - 393 day of immigration

Today I did nothing. It's pretty unique situation for me. Mentally I don't work for DR SMILE anymore. It's interesting thing because I am with them for the last three years. It's crazy. For me it's absolutely unusual situation and it's my personal record to work for someone for so big period of time. Usually I leave companies after two years or even less. I believe that I will start doing it again in Germany. I work for DR SMILE for 3 years only due to the war and immigration problems. But in one months I will be in Berlin. It twists my mind. It's so unusual and new. My way is so curvy. Also today is friday and it means that my vacation is already here. During the next week I will do nothing and recover after surgery. I have a operation on monday. I don't want to do it but I have to. I need to proceed this long path. Also I have to finish with a lot of things that are needed to be done. I didn't finish an article and video that should be released soon. Also I need to learn german and reshape my schedule again. There are a lot of things. I also want to walk around in Yerevan and say goodbye to this city. It did a lot for me. Armenia did a lot. I found a cool harbour for just keeping away from the war. It's so cool. I even want to do a tattoo with something armenian. Probably I will do ararat mountains. Also I want to tattoo spb symbol. I miss my home city very much. Also I miss my mom and other relatives.

# 28 October - Saturday - Yerevan - 394 day of immigration

This day I did nothing. Usually Saturday is a sacred day when I just have a rest. So, this day was a type. Me and Ksusha were in Saryana museum. I was impressed especially from color selection. It was really cool! After that we had a dinner in Hard Rock cafe. I mentioned many time that it's the best burger place in Yerevan. Also we were in Keta market in the city center. This time it was in Opera theater. I bought a couple of souvenirs there. I usually don't do it but this time I decided to allow it for myself. It's really rare situation. In general we just were waling for a whole day. Now I watching a video on youtube about ex-minister of agricultures in Komi republic. The life is interesting thing. Tomorrow I will start hard preparations for immigration to Berlin. I need to find some applications, understand how to pay taxes, and some other important things. So, November is almost began. 17 of November is the important day. I will be really happy when cross the border. Oh, I also recalled that I generated the first pdf file of holy theory. It's nice because it's a crucial part of my work on the book. The funny thing that pdf is more that 300 pages. It's a huge draft. I like it.

# 29 October - Sunday - Yerevan - 395 day of immigration

Today I was working for almost half of the day on test task for one company whose name I don't remember. It was nice task that encouraged me to recall Angular a bit. I will definitely reuse this code for another task. After this activity we went for a walk. One place on Saryana street has very nice wine and we wanted to visit it for a very long time, so, we did it today. Just after it I got a cup of nice African coffee but Columbian I like more. In Moscow cinema we watched Mother movie that is actually a thriller. It's a movie about poet and his wife that is actual not a wife but his muse and he is not a poet but God. The fantasy of authors is really limitless. I enjoyed this movie. I cannot say that this layering was very interesting because absolutely understandable. However I liked it. Another piece of news for today is that Matthew Perry passed away. This actor played a character in the Friends series. I really liked it. So sad that he died. However it was not a surprise because the person suffered from various of addictions. Another interesting fact that I read his autobiography and it's the first time when I started reading the book with alive author but will finish it with dead one. Also I am going to surgery tomorrow. It will be really expensive but I need to screw in two prosthetics again. The time has come. 

# 30 October - Monday - Yerevan - 396 day of immigration

I had a surgery today and finally got two another prosthetics and this is a finish. I am happy about that. After that I came back home and had a nap. In generally I don't feel good today unfortunately. The reason is the surgery. However I did everything I had to do like release of holy theory. I made a shot post as usual and published it on all platforms. Also I watched some german videos. So the vacation has been started and my focus for these future days is to finish with all things I had to finish. Tomorrow I will start doing it. I feel huge relief after screwing in these two latest prosthetics. It's so cool. Now I need only to restore full smile. I don't know how I will handle it in the future when I live in Germany but still maybe I will find ways to finish with treatment. The life is good again. I enjoy my life more and more. I am really exited about Germany. I hope everything will be good.
