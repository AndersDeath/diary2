# 01 November - Tuesday - Gündoğan - 33 day of immigration

I decided to count immigration days a month ago. I think it's important to remember the time of the new life. I consider that my previouse life has been end. And not only my life, but many people from Russia, Belarus and Ukrain had to change everything. The couse is obviouse - the war. I will call it the war despite the fact that it's prohibited in Russia. I also remembered that yesterday Ksusha found chamelion on roof terrace. It's so an interesting animal. It catched a chair and put it near a tree and chamelion moved to the tree this morning. Also I learned portuguese today and code a lot. When I was going to the shop I recorded another video about immigration. I will process itg and upload to youtube in the next morning. I'm very tiered today. It's really hard day. I woke up too early in the morning and didn't rest enough. I will go to sleep in time today.

# 02 November - Wednesday - Gündoğan - 34 day of immigration

Today I was working mostly on educatin and programming stuff. I finished with a lot of things. I woke up in time and immidiently started learing things. Also I published third video on my youtube channgel. I was speaking about internal immigration. I like to record videos it's just fun. I am trying to make myself better evey day. Luckily today I feel better than yesterday. I slept well. By the way I found photo studio which can take photos for green card lottery. It's very good. Tomorrow we are going to that place and after that we are going to fill the statement. I still have a hope to win that lottery. Sometimes I think a lot about immigation to USA. That country is not ideal, but I looks pretty predictable and understandable. It's about 17.00 o'clock. I am quite tiered and honestly really want to have a rest. We bought some local meatballs that I want to cook after a meeting where I am hanging now. It's Treatment expierence meeting. Tomorrow byt the wat I will finish with survey bullshit and just after that I will start working on photo shooting mechanism. It will be really interesting. I am also extriemly exited about boat trip that will be next saturday. It's a part of my old deam about becaming a yaht capitan. Other than that I've just recalled about
