# 01 June - Samstag - Berlin - 618 Tag der Einwanderung - Hot Sunny

I did a maniqure today and it was enjoyful for me. I will repeat it definitely. Then we were on templhof field and walked a lot. I enjoyed the day. In general I did just nothing and it was nice. This saturday was really nice and calm. I only learned a little bit german. Sometimes it's just cool to do nothing. Neighbours were screaming for a whole evening due to football match. Dortmund plated with Real. And lost.

# 02 June - Sonnstag - Berlin - 619 Tag der Einwanderung - Hot Sunny

I liked this Sunday. I did tons of things. For example I prepared a technical task for a freelancer that supposed to fix Mostmag finally. I am tiered of removing virus and I don't have enough time for it. I did my homework and prepared for tomorrow's onboarding in Visable. It's nice. I am happy to change the job. I hope to be good manager and will do it. Additionally I am glad to see nice progress with Holy Theory project. I am about to finish all things regarding builder and very soon it will be ready for new books. It's really cool. Now I will go to have a little bit rest. Oh, I forgot to mention. Very soon I am flying to Paris. Tickets are already bought.

# 03 June - Montag - Berlin - 620 Tag der Einwanderung - Hot Sunny

Today was my the first day in Visable company. I experienced a nice onboarding in the morning and recieved a pretty cool laptop for work. I was surprices because I didn't expect so nice thing. It's m3 laptop with tons of memory. In the end of the day I was really tired and barely could think. Because of visiting of the office I had to cancel german lesson. I don't like when something like this happened. It was sad. I also met some of my new colleegs. Yes. Final good buy to xu company. It was intersting buy I will not miss it.

# 04 June - Dienstag - Berlin - 621 Tag der Einwanderung - Warm Sunny

I have to rearrange my schedule because It's it really hard to do things now. I don't have time. This day was really hard. Tons of onboarding meetings just expoded my mind. I also was in the office today because I needed to be there. I cannot say that it was really enjoyable but still. I needed to be there. In common this comapny has a specific policy that forces people to be in the office twice per week. All other time we can work at home. It's not so good but me as a part of IT department can break the rule. I can be in the office 8 day in a row and then I can fomr home until the end of the month.

# 05 June - Mittwoch - Berlin - 622 Tag der Einwanderung - Warm Sunny

I was working from home for a whole day. I started scheduling meeting with my programmers. I have 5 people under me that is really nice for me. I wan't to esablish my skills better and better. So I need to work on it a lot. At the same time I found some minimal time for my own projects. All of the are hevily important for me. In the evening I was in Toastmasters club as a member for the first time. I need to find a time somewhere for dealing with all of this and understand what happened on the webside. The speaker career is important. This skill is essencial.

# 06 June - Donnerstag - Berlin - 623 Tag der Einwanderung - Warm Sunny

Today I had an arguments with Ksusha. It's really rare situation when we conflict. It was hard. I almost did nothing. I could only to concetrate somehow and visit German lesson. The day was horrible. Also I cannot undertand if dr smile sent me money or not. It looks like they fucked me up again. I hate them so much. They are absolutely insane and stupid morons. It's something unbelivable.

# 07 June - Freitag - Berlin - 624 Tag der Einwanderung - Warm Rainy

We are ok now. I believe that huge pressure that we experienced broke us a little bit. Luckily we handled this. Today I worked from home and it was good. I didn't do a lot of things because it's really hard to memorize everything. At the same time I did good progress this week in Visable. I talked to all people that I leed and it's really cool thing. I am happy about it. Funny thing is that this friday makes me really happy because I need to have a little rest. Well deserved rest.

# 08 June - Samstag - Berlin - 625 Tag der Einwanderung - Warm Sunny

I did literally nothing today. We were on closed radar station that was built by the US army during the cold war. It's a bunch of buildings are located on an artificial mountain in the Berlins part. I already forgot the name of it. The place is really cool. Berlin is stuffed by amazing places and all of them are cool and interesting. Also it's my first year in the country and that means I am still curious of everything happens here.

# 09 June - Sonnstag - Berlin - 626 Tag der Einwanderung - Cold Sunny

I decided to change an approach to the Holy Theory project. Before that I did weekly releases but now I don't have time. I am goung to change them to monthly ones. Tomorrow I will publish an article of it. At the same time I need to finalize the project in one month because I did good work but didn't do a workable proto. I need to change it. Besides that the weather changed and ruined all our plans. It's not a surprise because we are still in Europe.

# 10 June - Montag - Berlin - 627 Tag der Einwanderung - Cold 

The weather turned to really cold. I worked from home today and didn't go anywhere. It's just cold. Besides that nothing really fancy happened. I still don't have money from fucking DR SMILE. Tomorrow I am going to escalate the problem. If they don't change anything I will go to the their office and force them to talk to me in person. It's so stupid. Oh I forgot to mention it. They forgot to send moey to me. Fucking morons. I believe that they will fix it this week.

# 11 June - Diestag - Berlin - 628 Tag der Einwanderung - Cold Rainy

I had a full day of meeting today because I decided that tuesday is a good day for it. I am so tiered that I just cannot describe it. Also I try to resolve problem with my money. Oh how I hate them. In the eveniny I was on a meeting with CEO of Deutsche bank. He lies so well. I countes a couple of dozens rethorical trics and avoiding questions. He is very cool in it. I will publish an post about this meting next week.

# 12 June - Mittwoch - Berlin - 629 Tag der Einwanderung - Cold Rainy

I texted to fucking director of Finance from dr smile. THey just ignore me. It's so stupid. I worked from the office today. To be hones I am in so bad mood that I don't want to text here anything but I need to mention that I was on amazing event with toastmastes in the evening. I enjoyed it a lot.

# 13 June - Donnerstag - Berlin - 630 Tag der Einwanderung - Cold Rainy

I really like working from home. It makes me happy. So I did it. My working day are so intencive now that I really don't know what to say. Maybe I need to change an approach for making this notes. In the evening I had a nice german lesson. I started gradually understand something and it is really good. Maybe I will know German quite well in near future. Until then I need to work harder on it than I already do.

# 14 June - Freitag - Berlin - 631 Tag der Einwanderung - Cold Rainy

I finally got an answer from that morons. They sent my money yesterday, I hope they are not so crazy and I will recive them on monday. As craziness I mean possible mistakes that they can do in the payment statement. Also I am happy to be in Friday again. It means that I will have a cool weekend. Adtionaly I wouldlike to say that our relations with Ksusha is absolutely brilliant now. I'm happy. I love her so much and don't want to loose her.

# 15 June - Samstag - Berlin - 632 Tag der Einwanderung - Warm Sunny

The weather became normal finally. However I did literally nothing today I was at home and did nothing. Also I forgot to write here down that I was in the cinema this week. It was the first time in my life when I watched a movie without subtitles. The language was english subs were in german. Therefore I could not use text in the screen. It was cool and successful thing because I enjoyed the movied and understood everything.

# 16 June - Sonnerstag - Berlin - 633 Tag der Einwanderung - Warm Sunny

I finally did some cleaning in the apartments today. It's nice. Absence of time on my and Ksusha's sides lead us to dirty rooms that I don't like. Also I had a call with Arsenii and showed him Berlin a little bit. He was happy to talk to me. Also I finally finished thing that I postponed. The reason was absence of time. I am good and did a great job. If money from fucking smile will come to me tomorrow I will be much more happy than now. I hate them really. In general the day was nice and good. I liked it. I did a lot of things but also had a good rest.

# 17 June - Montag - Berlin - 634 Tag der Einwanderung - Warm Rainy

Money are not here. It's so annoying. I will wait until tommorow and if nothing changes escalate the problem. Today was a home office day. I just sat at home and did some business. It's really hard to do things without strong experience. It's something absolutely new. I try to be everywhere and to do things correctly. It's hard in general. Visable is my first company where I am a lead from the beginnig. It's also new thing. Besides that nothing significant happened. German lesson went nice. It was good.

# 18 June - Dienstag - Berlin - 635 Tag der Einwanderung - Warm Rainy

I decide that tuesday will be dedicated fully to 1-1 meetings and office work. So, I spent the whole day in the office and it was hard and nice in the same time. Additionaly my money fell to my account finally. I am really happy about it. I don't want to connect to drsmile anymore. They are absolutely crazy and unprofessional. It's annoying. The day was really busy. I don't have even time to think about something.

# 19 June - Mittwoch - Berlin - 636 Tag der Einwanderung - Warm Cloudy

My mood was not so good today. It's sad to be honest. I thougt that I would be able to buy somthing that I wanted to, but I could not. THe mood is on the lowest level in my life. However I texted to Dentist and started plannig of my Yerevan's trip. I finally have money to fix my teeth problem. It's really cool. This autums I will be with my cool new smile. The only problem is to get an agreement with my boss. I will work on it next week. Ksusha recived a message from her boss. So, tomorow she will visit her first object that she needs to make better as an enteriour designer. I'm happy for her.

# 20 June - Donnerstag - Berlin - Hamburg - 637 Tag der Einwanderung - Warm Cloudy

I am writing it from train to Hamburg. In 20 minutes I will be there. It's nice. Also it's my firt lonely trip to some place. I will be alone in hotel and I am only one in the carrier. As alone I mean absence of Ksusha. Surely there are some people, but I don't care about them. Also I've never been in Hamburg, it will be my first visit to the city. I expect to get nice experience. In general I believe everything will be good and cool. Ksusha met her boss and that meeting went well. I expect nice collaboration. Another thing - the train arrived and derpatured in time. It's something amazing and so unusual for Deutsche bahn.

# 21 June - Freitag - Hamburg - 638 Tag der Einwanderung - Warm Rainy

It's so strange thing when you are in such trips like I have now. The feeling that I am in the office even at night was with me for a whole day. In the morning I was on people management meating where heads of the company presented something about current state. It was really interesting and valuable for my personal grows because I saw how differently the same info can be presented for different audiences. So, in general this Visable is not in a good condition, but for me it's important to be here at least for one - two years. After that I can proceed my journey somewhere else. It's not final thing because I just started but really important. After that meeting we have a lunch with some snacks and them I was working from that office. Surely I did nothing because it was just hard. After that I went to hotel, spent some time there and went for a walk. Hamburg is such interesting and unusual city. It doesn't look like every place where I was. It's differetn and this is nice. The city is extremely rich. I liked it. After that walk I went to a company summer party where I saw how people smiled to each other. It's was a pretending festival. I liked it because it's again some new experience for me. I didn't drink alcohol and everything was nice and smooth for me. The party was in a chineese place that was beautiful. I enjoed in general. It was an absolutely new experience for me. Then I came back to hotel and went to bed. In general the day was really nice. I enjoyed it and what the most important - learned something new.

# 22 June - Samstag - Hamburg - Berlin - 639 Tag der Einwanderung - Warm Cloudy

Today I had a train from Hamburg to Berlin. It was deleyed for an hour but in general it was ok. Usually situation with this is much worse. I am happy to come back to Ksusha. Today we went for a walk and did a lot of interesting and cool things. Unfortunately I feel abosolutely demotivated to do something. I belive that it's an aftershok after two year streess, looking for another job and so on. I try to be ok and in good mood. It's hard. I should admit it, but I do my best. Also I finally need to buy something and I finally did it. I ordered a lot of stupid things that I hope will make me a little bit happier.

# 23 June - Sonnerstag - Berlin - 640 Tag der Einwanderung - Warm Rainy

I cannot get why that germans don't work on Sundays. It's so stupid. Because of this I have to be at hope or come up with some activities that I don't want to have. Today we went to Templhof airdrop and had fun there. We walked a lot and then came back home. In general this day was absolutely lazy and didn't have and siginificant valuable things inside. It was just calm and nothing. I was thinking a lot about that Hamburg trip and made some conclusions.

# 24 June - Montag - Berlin - 641 Tag der Einwanderung - Warm Rainy

I worked from home and It was nice. Also my skateboard is with me. I bought a cruiser and now I need to find some protection because I don't know how to skate properly. The helmet with other knee and arm shields should be here soon. It it really important to have them. Also I ordered a wierd podcast kit. to be honest I just did it due to cool sale offer. Besides that nothing significat happened but I started preparations to Paris.

# 25 June - Dienstag - Berlin - 642 Tag der Einwanderung - Warm Rainy

I was in the home office today. I worked on typical tasks and tried to find mindfuel for doning important things like writing articles. I don't want to do it. I am so tiered that it's just a violence to force myself doing it. Helmet came and it's so shitty that returned it back. I will go to a physicall shop. I don't know size and so. Bsides that nothing happened. The day was calm and cool.

# 26 June - Mittwoch - Berlin - 643 Tag der Einwanderung - Warm Rainy

In the office I was on a lunch with Chinese colleges. It was so stupic and shitty that I didn't know what to think. The heads of Visable are really old fasion businessmen that try to push dust in partners eyes. It was so ridiculous and fun. I hope that understand what they do but I am not sure. BVG ticket from my company is still not with me. It's also fun because it's another fuck up from provider's side. Some clothes came to me and I am happy because I almost packed for Paris. It's really nice.

# 27 June - Donnerstag - Berlin - 644 Tag der Einwanderung - Warm Rainy

Nothing happened today. Really I just was at home for a whole day and did my job. Besides that I didn't do anything. German lessin surely was and that's it. It was such a stupid and meaningless day. Quite rare situtation to be honest. Tomorrow we are flying to Paris and it's cool.

# 28 June - Freitag - Berlin - Paris - 645 Tag der Einwanderung - Warm Rainy

I didn't do a lot of things because my main goal today was to pack my suitecase and backpack. I was in the office, looked at some strange and stupid things and then came back hope. Just after this we went to Brandenburg airport. The flyght was calm and short. It's 1.40 hour from Berlin to Paris. It's quite short distance. In France capital we met Alina that is Ksusha's old friend. We rent an apartment together and also planned our trip. I am really excited about this weekend.

# 29 June - Freitag - Paris - 646 Tag der Einwanderung - Cool Rainy

So, Paris it amazing. I am so happy to be there again and with money. It's so cool. Today we were walking in the city center and whatched a lot of cool building, museums and stuff. One of the points was to visit new excibition are in ex-Birzha. I don't know how to write it downd and it's why I used russian word. Also we were walking and looking for something. In commot in Paris you can just go and enjoy. All that things makes the day amazing. At the end we were on the top of Eifel tower. I was happy to repeat that experience because it's 11 years passed when I was there last time. So, the day was nice but I am tiered as fuck.

# 30 June - Sonntag - Paris - 647 Tag der Einwanderung - Cool Rainy

Today we again were walking around. Our stamina has gone. It's hard to walk at 36 years old like when I was 25. It's really diferent, but money compensate it. So, Paris became really better for all that years, local authorities did great job. Also The olympic games are about to start in the city. It makes everything better but construction is everywhere and it's a little bit frustrating. So, also we were today on Louis vitone center that is build in post-constructivism style. I liked it very much. In general it's hard to describe all my impressions. Everything was really cool. I would like to visit Paris again in the future.

# 01 Juli - Montag - Paris - 648 Tag der Einwanderung - Cool Rainy

Today I was working in the first part of the days and was walking alone in the second one. Alina and Ksusha went to Disnay land without me. It was cool because I really wanted to walk alone. I was on Monparnas and just walked in the city center, took photos, looked at libraries and universities. That places are very pwerful for me. I like to be there. I was alone for a whole day and was thinking a lot about my life. I am ready for recharging doing cool things again. I feel much better. I needed to have such trip. It's cool to be with money and live in Europe with local documents. Also I got an idea that Paris in what Saint-Peterburg wanted to be. It's just strange but something like this.

# 02 Juli - Dienstag - Paris - Berlin - 649 Tag der Einwanderung - Cool Rainy

Today we sad good buy to Alina in the morning and then went to Orly airport. I need to say that place is not so good as I expected. Surely it's another big international airport and so on, but the place is quite badly organized. After checkin and passing control we had to find an internal bus that moved us to real barn on the edge of airport. It was quite stupid. Also french people are not so friendly like germans usually are. Besides that they don't duplicate anouncements in egnlish. It was quite annoing. After arriving to Berlin we came home smoothly and without any problems. It was nice. We had a little rest and were ok.

# 03 Juli - Mittwoch - Berlin - 650 Tag der Einwanderung - Cool Rainy

I had to miss Toastmasters today because I didn't feel well. The flight made me so tiered. I in general don't feel so good for having all those additional activities I planned before. Howerver I try to do my best for being ok.I know that I am moaning again but it's my diary and it supposes to have such notes as well. IN general day was nice. I did my job and having rest.

# 04 Juli - Donnerstag - Berlin - 651 Tag der Einwanderung - Warm Clear sky

This morning I checked my eyes in some weird clinic. I experted to have some normal checkup but in face I just experiences some strange stuff. Surely they checked my eyes but if face they didn't offer me to have anything. I cannot get glasses or something like this. It was just waste of time and useless. Also I am conitueing to fight with XU for documents. They answer so slow and it annoys me a lot. In general I face with such behaviour every time in Germany. They are not organized at all. They have so many rules that they follow but if something happens out of them, Germans do nothing. It makes me mad. So stupid. However I need to learn their language that I did today again. Step by step I dive deeper and deepers to it. It's really cool.

# 05 Juli - Freitag - Berlin - 652 Tag der Einwanderung - Warm Clear sky

I recieved all final papers from XU and also was fucked a little by. They desided that I should not have birthday certificat because I left company. It was so stupid because at that moment I was a employee. It is unfair and speaks a lot about them. I am preparing an plan agains them that I will do definetly. Besides review on some websited I also plan contacting to ex coleeges and say some words about them. It's my intention. I will do what I need to do. It will be fair as well. Besided that nothing really interesting happened today. Life goes and I struggel with it.

# 06 Juli - Samstag - Berlin - 653 Tag der Einwanderung - Warm Clear sky

We wanted to visit a botanic garden but cancelled it due to lazyness. The good thing that I finally bought some skateboarding protection that allows me to stard using my skateboard. The probles is time. I need time for it. So, yes we were walking for a whole day and everything was really nice. It was cool calm saturday that I missed so much. It was nice.

# 07 Juli - Sonntag - Berlin - 654 Tag der Einwanderung - Warm Clear sky

It's hard to find so useless day in this uneverce. we were walking and sitting at home. Not more. I literally did nothing today. Usually it is quite rare situation but this is a fact. I did nothing.

# 08 Juli - Montag - Berlin - 655 Tag der Einwanderung - Warm Rainy

This monday is really important. I finally slpit my Holy Theory project to two parts. The first one is a piece of software for building books and another one is about wiritng a book itself. I thought about it for a really long time. The biggest consern that I had was impossibility of publishubg software and text under the same licence. In fact If I want to protect what I do I must split them and select proper licences for them. I decided to use gpl2 for soft and some other for text. I am going to change versioning approach as well. It's important thing in general. So yes. It is a new step of my projct. I am really exited to having something new. I need to pick a name for software, theoretical articles will be Holy Theory like it was planned initially. Besides that I was in the office today and did a lot of interesting things.

# 09 Juli - Dienstag - Berlin - 656 Tag der Einwanderung - Warm Rainy

I selected new name for the project, I will be called flexographer. It is a little bit long but I don't care. It's is a name for the soft, not for a product. The weather in Berling quite shitty. Rains are really heavy and try to wash everybody away. This is crazy. But it is what it is. I still don't have time to start writing a rewive to XU company. I need to plan it finally. Also I decided to stop using DUOLINGO at all. I was using it for 455 days in a row which was crazy and addicitve. I am happy to get rid of it.

# 10 Juli - Mittwoch - Berlin - 657 Tag der Einwanderung - Warm Rainy

The office day was nice and rainy a litte bit. In the evening I was on Toastmasters meeting and It was absolutely disaster. First of all I was aextremely tiered and the place where we were was extremely heat. I could not brethe almost. Crazy. Because of it I left the meeting in the middle of it and the heavy rain cought me. I was so bad that I had to move my passport to the pants pocket because my backpack literally was watered. It was crazy.

# 11 Juli - Donnerstag - Berlin - 658 Tag der Einwanderung - Warm Rainy

I was at home toaday. I like such days. Office is a good thing is some respect but destroying. Every time I struggle because of something there. However I had a nice day at home and did nothing. I like such days so much. Some cool things were delivered at home and it was also cool.

# 12 Juli - Freitag - Berlin - 659 Tag der Einwanderung - Warm Rainy

Today we were in the cinema and whatched a movide in english. I don't remember a name of it but it was a light film about Chennig tatum and how he was participating in Apllo program. It was really fun. But the funniest thing that made day was a karaoke box with 4 girls inside that were signing Руки Вверх band song. Karaoke box is a cabin, that looks like street toulet or photo box where you can close youself, pay some money and sing a song. The reall fun thing that I could not expect such stuff with such song on Uber platz in the middle of Berlin. It's crazy.

# 13 Juli - Samstag - Berlin - 660 Tag der Einwanderung - Warm Sunny

One of the main principles for me on this stage of my life is to have a good rest. Today I did nothing. It was really good. I can highly recommend it to others. I will do it again and againg in my life.

# 14 Juli - Sonnstag - Berlin - 661 Tag der Einwanderung - Warm Sunny

We finally were in Botanic garden. It is nice place but it's not so atmospheric I would say. If you ask me to rate all botanic gardens I were inside I would place Yerevan's one to the first place, Saint-Petersburg's one to the second, and the Berlin's Botanic garthe I place to third. It was nice but not so phantastic or atmospheric. Yea. But I am really glad to visit it finally. Besides that we were walking today and had a lot of calm, nice moments.

# 15 Juli - Montag - Berlin - 662 Tag der Einwanderung - Warm Sunny

One of the most important things in my life is to have a schedule. I don't put everything to this but I really thing it's crusial to have some big parts planned. I decided that tuesdays and wednesdays will be my office ones. I can change it only occasionally. Also I decide to stop using todoist. Yes, it's a cool piece of software but I don't use the full potentional of it. Payebal services are not for me. It's just my credo. I can pay for somthing only in case of unavoidable necessity. So, I moved all my deals to apple reminder. It will be enough. Also I started using apple calendar because I can accumulate all my calendart including business in one place. I really need it.

# 16 Juli - Diestag - Berlin - 663 Tag der Einwanderung - Warm Sunny

Office day was nice but annoying. I didn't sleep well and it made me soft and stupid. I aslo cannot find power for returning to sport again. I am not happy about myself. I should be changed. You can notice that I struggle with it for all my life. Unfortunatly I can't find specific motivation for doing sport on daily basis. Nothing can help me.

# 17 Juli - Mittwoch - Berlin - 664 Tag der Einwanderung - Warm Sunny

I was so tiered that just skip another Toastmasters meeting. It was bad but I could not. My office problem is still with me, I cannot focus there and cannot find power for concentration. The road is not destroying me anymore like it was in Saint-Petersburg, but the weather and my condition in general just remove all power from me. However who did say that I would be easy? I resolved all main immigrational problem but I still in some aftershock after all bullshit that happened to me. The life is not fair. It's just true.

# 18 Juli - Donnerstag - Berlin - 665 Tag der Einwanderung - Hot Sunny

My stepfather had a birthday today. Sometimes when I think about his and my mother's lifes I feel regret. They are so smart people but live in very bad conditions and don't have mental power for changing it. It's really sad. I wish them all the best but It's still very very sad. Besides that I was happy to work from home and having smooth day. I liked it so much. I need to anjust my schedule to that office visites. All my habits were shaped around fully remote work but now it changed. This is damn true.

# 19 Juli - Freitag - Berlin - 666 Tag der Einwanderung - Hot Sunny

I felt so tiered today that it is even hard to describe. I don't remember when I was so tired last time. I was working for a whole day on different interesting and not things and did my job. The temperature outside is really hot. It't not so easy to be concentrated on job due to it. However we did a small present to ourselfs this evening. We were in Thai massage salon. The main thing that it normal massage salon without happy end. It was really nice. I experienced such massage for the first time in my life. It was really nice. My back sad thank you to be. Surely It was imposible to pay by card there. It was no a surprice. I don't know if they just turned off pos terminal or payments didn't work due to huge fail on windows machines. It's not clear.

# 20 Juli - Sontag - Berlin - 667 Tag der Einwanderung - Hot Sunny

This saturday was absolutely cool as for me.
