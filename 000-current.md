# 01 June - Samstag - Berlin - 618 Tag der Einwanderung - Hot Sunny

I did a maniqure today and it was enjoyful for me. I will repeat it definetely. Then we were on templhof field and walked a lot. I enjoyed the day. In general I did just nothing and it was nice. This saturday was really nice and calm. I only learned a little bit german. Sometimes it's just cool to do nothing. Neighbours were screaming for a whole evening due to football match. Dortmund plated with Real. And lost.

# 02 June - Sonnstag - Berlin - 619 Tag der Einwanderung - Hot Sunny

I liked this Sunday. I did tons of things. For example I prepared a technical task for a freelancer that supposed to fix Mostmag finally. I am tiered of removing virus and I don't have enough time for it.
