# 01 December - Thursday - Gündoğan - 63 day of immigration

Today is 2 months since i left Russia. I still feel bad. I really dream about a moment when I can be in good mood and calm. I feel that I am extrimely tiered of the situation. I know that much more people in worse situation that me, but I feel it as it is. I am also extrimely tiered of the working for DR SMile. It seems that I am very close to be burned out. 

Despite the my mood I try to do things in time. I go through my todolist, don't forget about lessons, and try to study something everyday.
