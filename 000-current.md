# 01 September - Friday - Yerevan - 337 day of immigration

The summer has gone. I did a test task for wunderflats today. I enjoyed this coding and I can expect good result. I don't know what will be with me, but maybe everything will be cool. I would like t work for them, really. This morning my dentist did teeth cleaning for me. it was really successful because they changed color. It's amazing. Tomorrow I will go to another procedure with an another tooth. In general I was working only on test task today. Whatever the outcome, I will reshape this and add to my portfolio. The thing works fine in general and I enjoy it.

So, Today I was in dentist's cabinet again. Everything went well and I will probably save this tooth. Me and Ksusha also were walking a bit in the city center. The hardest thing is the weather. Today was about 35 degrees. By the way the autumn is already here. It's absolutely impossible heat for Saint-Petersburg. Despite this fact I miss home. I still do it. It's probably some pain that is impossible to fix. I would be happy to walk on Nevski avenue or on some other streets. I also miss Bugry so much. I miss my relatives. the war cut this option to visit this place. Before the beginning of the tragedy I thought about visiting home several times every ear just buying tickets to airplane. But now there are not air routes from Berlin to Saint-Petersburg anymore. Fucking Putin destroyed this. Additionally I read quite cool book that was written by a nobel prize owner where he provide an information about how our cognitive systems work. In fact if a person has unlimited amount of power they becomes blind even if nobody gives wrong information about the world and about some situations. In simple words when you have power you don't have doubts. And this is some mechanism that we have in our brains. It's hard work to learn how to avoid this deviations. Obviously people in Russian government doesn't know about it. I think they read only Kolobok once.

Today is a final day of mu current vacation. I rested a bit and this is good. I even returned to meditation and yoga. Only one week and I found power for it again. I also reviewed a contract with XU company. I found several questions that will be sent tomorrow's evening. I need to save some time for another interviews. I don't want to sign a contract with XU even if it's a good chance to be relocated. Another two companied have great conditions for relocation. It's important. At the same time I don't want to refuse this offer and stay without them at all. It will be so disgusting and hard. Also we were walking with Ksusha today a bit. She felt bad due to hormonal things and Yerevan's heat. It's 35 today. It's still too much for me. And for all of us. Tomorrow I will proceed working for DR SMILE which I find as boring thing. I'm tiered of them completely despite the fact that some cool projects started within my area of responsibility. Anyway I would be happy to change place and finally work in some other environment. Currently it's something about future. Fortunately it's about nearest future.

# 04 September - Monday - Yerevan - 340 day of immigration

The first working day was nice and hard. Unfortunately I didn't get an answer from the wunderflats. Maybe tomorrow they will text something to me. I found that I had a plan to write an article about how to get data from github. So, I refactored code a bit and when I have free time the writing process will be started. I have some plan to become an author on hackernoon. Anyway I also found a way how to demonstrate some important info on my portfolio website. In general day was hard but a bit boring. All these steps are quite tiresome.

# 05 September - Tuesday - Yerevan - 341 day of immigration

This working day finally finished. I fucked up today's interview. I could not do a task and I also spoke a lot of shit. so, I am upset. Anyway I did something good today despite the fact that I wasn't in good mood. Yesterday I felt nice, but today I am bad. It's bullshit. Because of that interview I don't want to do anything. I did everything wrong. Anyway it's good lesson for me. I am really want to finish all this hiring process as soon as possible. I am tiered of it. It's almost a 8 months since I started interviews. Hate it. At the same time, starting working for XU means that I will ned to looking for another position in 4 months after starting working for them. It will be in march. Fuck that shit. I want to just live without pressure, and this is impossible. I am not depressed. I am just tired and upset.

# 06 September - Wednesday - Yerevan - 342 day of immigration

The day was nice and hard. I even did something for drsmile. Usually it's hard. I was in Podologist cabinet she performed procedures on my legs. I hope that I will be ok soon and will not think about current problem. I hate it and I am tiered of it. also I had two interviews today. the first one was with startup and another one with General electric healthcare division. It was interesting but long. I did my best. I also got a rejection for yesterday's interview. I would be really surprised if I passed it. Everything finished like I expected - rejection.

# 07 September - Thursday - Yerevan - 343 day of immigration

So, I got an invitation to Wunderflats. I will have a technical call tomorrow. I hope everything will be good. Also DRS MILE again didn't send money to me. It's awful bullshit that destroys me. I am happy that this will be finished soon. I don't want to be there anymore. The product turned to moe interesting direction, but management level sucks. Besides that I improved portfolio website significantly. Tomorrow I will proceed working on it because I cannot do anything that are related to DR SMILE. I pissed of the money situation. I also improved holy theory project a bit and created two other scripts that generate html and markdown websites.

# 08 September - Friday - Yerevan - 344 day of immigration

So, I had an interview with Wunderflats today. It was absolutely controversial. I don't expect a good result. i hope they will give me an answer on monday. I also finally got money from fucking financial department. I also updated portfolio website. I still working on articles that I will finish soon. THis is extremely important. I have much more time because the number of interviews decreased significantly. However I pissed of DR SMILE again. This situation with money, absence of answer about three years working vacation. I even think bad about my shared plan that they have to me to me after december in January. Bullshit all this stuff. I just don't believe to them and I will be extremely surprised if they send that paycheck to me.

# 09 September - Saturday - Yerevan - 345 day of immigration

Today was a nice holiday. I visited my dentist. She healed my another tooth. It's cool. Me and Ksusha also were walking in the city center as usual. After that I called to Oleg finally. He was in Serbia then in Kazakhstan and now he's in Philippines. He tried to immigrate to Portugal but it was unsuccessful. It's sad. Now he is looking for other opportunities and just has a rest. Manila is dangerous and he lives in the next to capital other city. I don't remember the name of it. I am happy that he's ok now. I also hope that I will have the opportunity to meet him again. He is my friend. I don't have a lot of them anymore and I really dare about our friendship. It's so stupid how the war divided us all. When I think about I feel soulpain. Anyway I am about to be in Berlin. It will be hard but interesting. I cannot even predict what will be there.I hope everything will be good.

# 10 September - Sunday - Yerevan - 346 day of immigration

This day was nice. we were walking, I stared editing video about Barcelona finally. Tomorrow will be good day all other thinks with happen. I still don't want to work for DR SMILE because I tiered of them. I also tried to understand ESOP plan from XU. Honestly I didn't get everything. Anyway I don't think about it at all. The with 6 months in the company will be probation period. At the same time I will start looking for another position. I don't believe that this company is the amazing unimaginable place. So I want to repeat, the day was nice. I also got some wine which is quite rare situation. However I found a little bit of time for updating of Holy Theory and portfolio. Well, I will pour another portion of wine.

# 11 September - Monday - Yerevan - 347 day of immigration

I fucked up Wunderflats. I didn't pass technical interview. I wasn't ready and fucked this up. It's so stupid. I am really disappointed because I had hope. In fact my xu offer is't the best think that I want to have but I am so tiered of this configuration of life. So, anyway I need to sign a contract with XU and then move to Berlin. They will be my ticket to Germany. after some rest and preparations I will proceed looking for managerial position. my plan is to relocate my body, make documents and find another place for work. It will be relatively simple I suppose. In general this day was good but I was nervous because of waiting some answer from wunderflats. I improved some important parts of my portfolio and proceeded working on github article. I will release all this things soon. I want to buy bolshakov.tech and to place my portfolio there. So yes. Another good news that our passports are going to us from Moscow. BLS will receive them soon. After that I need to take my russian passport from embassy and then all will be good.

# 12 September - Tuesday - Yerevan - 348 day of immigration

18.45 Yerevan's time. I signed a contract with The XU. I also had a call with GE and it was quite messy and unelectable. Some adult men were listened to me and was asking questions. It was nice. Besides this I was working on my portfolio and articles. Tomorrow I am going to edit video in the morning and then working on DR SMILE's tasks. Now time works for me and nobody can fire me. I am in safe position. XU can't cancel the offer. Now they should support me with relocation and documents. After that I will select a German embassy that will help me with it. It's interesting that I almost one year abroad and I found a way how to leave Armenia. I will keep this country in my heart forever. They are amazing.

# 13 September - Wednesday - Yerevan - 349 day of immigration

The day was long and nice. I was implementing some stuff for DR SMILE and was working of portfolio. I also need to prepare some code for demonstration to Oxolo company. I will finish with this tomorrow. I am also going to Dentist tomorrow. It will be control checkup after extraction of three teeth. I am quite tired and stuff. I also started doing some sport again. I don't feel anything about it yet, but maybe it will be good thing on long distance. I don't like sport and it's really hard for me to introduce it to my daily life. The weather in Yerevan became cold. It's worse than I expected. 35 degrees have gone and now it's 15 degrees outside. Huge difference isn't it?

# 14 September - Thursday - Yerevan - 350 day of immigration

Today we got visas to Spain. They gave us them for one months. Also we are about to start applying for a working visa to Germany. It will be interesting and challenging thing. I also closed a couple of tasks for DR SMILE which is nice. Honestly this day finished so fast that I don't know what to add. The other thing is that I was in Dentist office and it's good. The first half of the day we were working from Cafe and it's cool. I still cannot understand that I will live in Berlin. It's so weird. I should be honest to you. It was my dream. I grew up on stories about immigrants and I am the same person. It's ridicules.

# 15 September - Friday - Yerevan - 351 day of immigration

Finally today is Friday. I am a bit tiered as usual. I did a lot of work today. I was working on portfolio and other stuff. I decided to translate my two articles written in Russian to English. I also was coding a bit. I also had a conversation with a product manager from General electric. He shared some cool insights to me. In common it's conversation was nice. The day was calm and hard. I am happy that it finished.

# 16 September - Saturday - Yerevan - 352 day of immigration

I visited barber today. It's high probability that I will visit him one more time. After that I need to looking for someone on Berlin. On monday I am going to talk to agency that will help me with documents. I am almost ready for it. It's still a little bit scary. It will be a completely new page for me. I am so exited about immigration to Germany that I cannot stop thinking about it. I will be devastated is something goes wrong. However everything looks good. On monday I will get more information. The next week will be the week of birthdays. My mom, Oleg and Ksusha will become older in one year. At the same time I still learning Spanish and I am sure that I will speak this language without a problem. Please remember this words. I will know four languages at least. Russian as native, English as working, German for living, and Spanish for soul. I think that knowing of many languages is a sigh of high educated person.

# 17 September - Sunday - Yerevan - 353 day of immigration

THis day wasn't nice.
