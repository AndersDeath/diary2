# 01 November - Wednesday - Yerevan - 398 day of immigration

Today I was working on entities for my nx setup. It was interesting and nice. I'm going to finish working on it. BRsided that I was learning German and doing other things. I pissed off of dR SMILE. These morons didn't send money to me again. It makes me really angry. I really want to finish working for them as soon as possible. I pissed off. Also I found how to reach out railway station in Dortmund. It will be easier than I expect because this place has shuttle bus from airport to railway station. It's really nice and not so expensive. Just 10 euros and I am there. In general my vacation goes smooth. I have time to work on many things I spend this time smart. Also me and Ksusha were in cafe today. We got lunch and worked from that place. In couple of minutes we will go to the cinema. Yep, Vacation goes well. I like it.

# 02 November - Thursday - Yerevan - 399 day of immigration

I feel very angry for an unknown reasons. It's been happening since yesterday. It's really simple for me to go out of temper. I don't like it but cannot do anything with it. It's just needed to be mentioned. Also we were in the cinema yesterday in the evening. we watched Killers of the Flower Moon. It's a movie about white americans that were ready for everything for getting oil fields from native americans. It's really powerful picture. I highly recommend to look at it. Today I was doing usual things according my daily plan.Additionally I build a special version of telegram bot that helps me in learning of german words. It was important thing. Also I visited my Podologist, maybe last time. I am not sure that I will got to get at 14 of November. Probably I will just cancel this schedule. Tomorrow I will proceed working on my usual things.

# 03 November - Friday - Yerevan - 400 day of immigration

Oh, 400th day of my immigration. It's interesting. 400 days ago I understood that the war will not end and I have to leave the country. Before that I considered Yerevan as a temporary place for work and waiting for collapse of Russian army, but the war is still here. Also Palestine and Israel are fighting to each other. It's absolutely scary situation. I feel like the world got crazy. But let's go back to me. I did a lot of things today. I woke up early in the morning. I was editing the barcelona video, added some updated to holy theory, and was working on other things. Unfortunately at least the half of my vacation ended. It's sad. Other this is that in two week we will be in Germany. It's crazy. I still cannot believe in it. I will be a complete immigrant. It's so crazy. I don't understand if it's good or bad. It's something new. I am excited and scared at the same time. The completely new life will start for me and Ksusha. It's crazy. I realized that I cannot feel it normally. Some weird emotions come to me.
