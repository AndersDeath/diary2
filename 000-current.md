# 01 March - Wednesday - Yerevan - 153 day of immigration

Today I was working for whole day on DR SMILE projects. My local Angular setup has been broken and nothing works. It's absolutely sad thing. It means that tomorrows morning I will be working on resolving of this thing. I was talking to Narayan for whole day. This man is from India and he works for Dr SMILE as front-end engineer. I didn't have tim eto make a lot of commits unfortunately. I added two trainings to Holy Theory. I like this project. tomorrow I will work a lot on docker containerization. Also I am going to work on another things related to system design questions. I've got an access to Notion AI today. This tool is amazing but it has a tiny limit of requests. I spent them all on useless requests, but I had fun. Besides that I had a call wit Olga where we discussed things that we are working on now and difficulties that we have. It's a good thing because It changes bad stuff and made me calmer. by the way It's +16 in Yerevan today. The weather is cool.

I was in Podolog office today. I need to treat heel for about two weeks more. I visited Ineco office and they finally moved me to basic tariff which is much better. I have much more convenient conditions now. Besides that I finished three leetcode challenges. I've still been working on readme project. I am going to finish with this version very soon. Right now I added almost all that I wanted to add. Interesting topic will be gathering of information and monitoring. This is for the future. At the same time I feel myself better today. I've started using of mood tracker. I'm worried about possible bi-polar disorder. I cannot understand why my mood can be so different. It's hard. I know that I have ADHD. I never checked it, but I have all evidences of it.
