The conflict with Marat has gone. The day was rainy and cold. I was working on many many things. Honestly I fell tiered and broken. Short night will make me better.

The wheather became better and it affected my productivity. I did sport, meditation, language learning and a bit product thinking lessons. Also I want to dive deeper into business. i think I've finished with main pieces of ng-firebase-auth project and can proceed on building some kind of simple business idea there. Probably links storage or simple todo list will be fine. Also I am going to start working on article. The basis for it is already finished. I need to formilize all that shit and do my best. I think following to rules that I figure out for myself several years ago pushes my effitiency now only. But i am happy that I feel it and do better everything. also I think to become ruthless in order to achieve even more

Today is just free day. We went to the city center again. We were in Vasiliostrovsky market which was reconstructed several years ago and became a food court. Currently this place has a lot of restaraunts for different tastes. After that we walked through the city center and visited Novaya Gollandia, which is a important culture center in Saint-Petersburg. Then we get a trolleybus and went home. At the same time we bought a dinner in Vkusno i Tochka - ex-Macdonalds. Big tastie is absolutly the same like in the past. They didn't change anything. Only coca-cola has gone from this place. now we are preparing for driving to gulf of finland. I really enjoy that place and will be happy to visit it again. Ksusha is takling to her mother by phone while I am writing these lines. Oh, I've just recolled. I've changed a structure of this diary. Now I separated everything by months and numbers. It's cool for sorting information. At the same time I have couple words about yesterday's evening.
