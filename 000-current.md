# 01 September - Friday - Yerevan - 337 day of immigration

The summer has gone. I did a test task for wunderflats today. I enjoyed this coding and I can expect good result. I don't know what will be with me, but maybe everything will be cool. I would like t work for them, really. This morning my dentist did teeth cleaning for me. it was really successful because they changed color. It's amazing. Tomorrow I will go to another procedure with an another tooth. In general I was working only on test task today. Whatever the outcome, I will reshape this and add to my portfolio. The thing works fine in general and I enjoy it.

# 02 September - Saturday - Yerevan - 338 day of immigration

So, Today I was in dentist's cabinet again. Everything went well and I will probably save this tooth. Me and Ksusha also were walking a bit in the city center. The hardest thing is the weather. Today was about 35 degrees. By the way the autumn is already here. It's absolutely impossible heat for Saint-Petersburg. Despite this fact I miss home. I still do it. It's probably some pain that is impossible to fix. I would be happy to walk on Nevski avenue or on some other streets. I also miss Bugry so much. I miss my relatives. the war cut this option to visit this place. Before the beginning of the tragedy I thought about visiting home several times every ear just buying tickets to airplane. But now there are not air routes from Berlin to Saint-Petersburg anymore. Fucking Putin destroyed this. Additionally I read quite cool book that was written by a nobel prize owner where he provide an information about how our cognitive systems work. In fact if a person has unlimited amount of power they becomes blind even if nobody gives wrong information about the world and about some situations. In simple words when you have power you don't have doubts. And this is some mechanism that we have in our brains. It's hard work to learn how to avoid this deviations. Obviously people in Russian government doesn't know about it. I think they read only Kolobok once.

# 03 September - Sunday - Yerevan - 339 day of immigration

Today is a final day of mu current vacation. I rested a bit and this is good. I even returned to meditation and yoga. Only one week and I found power for it again. I also reviewed a contract with XU company. I found several questions that will be sent tomorrow's evening. I need to save some time for another interviews. I don't want to sign a contract with XU even if it's a good chance to be relocated. Another two companied have great conditions for relocation. It's important. At the same time I don't want to refuse this offer and stay without them at all. It will be so disgusting and hard. Also we were walking with Ksusha today a bit. She felt bad due to hormonal things and Yerevan's heat. It's 35 today. It's still too much for me. And for all of us. Tomorrow I will proceed working for DR SMILE which I find as boring thing. I'm tiered of them completely despite the fact that some cool projects started within my area of responsibility. Anyway I would be happy to change place and finally work in some other environment. Currently it's something about future. Fortunately it's about nearest future.

# 04 September - Monday - Yerevan - 340 day of immigration

The first working day was nice and hard. Unfortunately I didn't get an answer from the wunderflats. Maybe tomorrow they will text something to me. I found that I had a plan to write an article about how to get data from github. So, I refactored code a bit and when I have free time the writing process will be started. I have some plan to become an author on hackernoon. Anyway I also found a way how to demonstrate some important info on my portfolio website. In general day was hard but a bit boring. All these steps are quite tiresome.

# 05 September - Tuesday - Yerevan - 341 day of immigration

This working day finally finished. I fucked up today's interview. I could not do a task and I also spoke a lot of shit. so, I am upset. Anyway I did something good today despite the fact that I wasn't in good mood. Yesterday I felt nice, but today I am bad. It's bullshit. Because of that interview I don't want to do anything. I did everything wrong. Anyway it's good lesson for me. I am really want to finish all this hiring process as soon as possible. I am tiered of it. It's almost a 8 months since I started interviews. Hate it. At the same time, starting working for XU means that I will ned to looking for another position in 4 months after starting working for them. It will be in march. Fuck that shit. I want to just live without pressure, and this is impossible. I am not depressed. I am just tired and upset.

# 06 September - Wednesday - Yerevan - 342 day of immigration

The day was nice and hard. I even did something for drsmile. Usually it's hard. I was in Podologist cabinet she performed procedures on my legs. I hope that I will be ok soon and will not think about current problem. I hate it and I am tiered of it. also I had two interviews today. the first one was with startup and another one with General electric healthcare division. It was interesting but long. I did my best. I also got a rejection for yesterday's interview. I would be really surprised if I passed it. Everything finished like I expected - rejection.

# 07 September - Thursday - Yerevan - 343 day of immigration

So, I got an invitation to Wunderflats. I will have a technical call tomorrow. I hope everything will be good. Also DRS MILE again didn't send money to me. It's awful bullshit that destroys me. I am happy that this will be finished soon. I don't want to be there anymore. The product turned to moe interesting direction, but management level sucks. Besides that I improved portfolio website significantly. Tomorrow I will proceed working on it because I cannot do anything that are related to DR SMILE. I pissed of the money situation. I also improved holy theory project a bit and created two other scripts that generate html and markdown websites.

# 08 September - Friday - Yerevan - 344 day of immigration

So, I had an interview with Wunderflats today. It was absolutely controversial. I don't expect a good result. i hope they will give me an answer on monday. I also finally got money from fucking financial department. I also updated portfolio website. I still working on articles that I will finish soon. THis is extremely important. I have much more time because the number of interviews decreased significantly. However I pissed of DR SMILE again. This situation with money, absence of answer about three years working vacation. I even think bad about my shared plan that they have to me to me after december in January. Bullshit all this stuff. I just don't believe to them and I will be extremely surprised if they send that paycheck to me.

# 09 September - Saturday - Yerevan - 345 day of immigration

Today was a nice holiday. I visited my dentist. She healed my another tooth. It's cool. Me and Ksusha also were walking in the city center as usual. After that I called to Oleg finally. He was in Serbia then in Kazakhstan and now he's in Philippines. He tried to immigrate to Portugal but it was unsuccessful. It's sad. Now he is looking for other opportunities and just has a rest. Manila is dangerous and he lives in the next to capital other city. I don't remember the name of it. I am happy that he's ok now. I also hope that I will have the opportunity to meet him again. He is my friend. I don't have a lot of them anymore and I really dare about our friendship. It's so stupid how the war divided us all. When I think about I feel soulpain. Anyway I am about to be in Berlin. It will be hard but interesting. I cannot even predict what will be there.I hope everything will be good.

# 10 September - Sunday - Yerevan - 346 day of immigration

This day was nice. we were walking, I stared editing video about Barcelona finally. Tomorrow will be good day all other thinks with happen. I still don't want to work for DR SMILE because I tiered of them. I also tried to understand ESOP plan from XU. Honestly I didn't get everything. Anyway I don't think about it at all. The with 6 months in the company will be probation period. At the same time I will start looking for another position. I don't believe that this company is the amazing unimaginable place. So I want to repeat, the day was nice. I also got some wine which is quite rare situation. However I found a little bit of time for updating of Holy Theory and portfolio. Well, I will pour another portion of wine.

# 11 September - Monday - Yerevan - 347 day of immigration

I fucked up Wunderflats. I didn't pass technical interview. I wasn't ready and fucked this up. It's so stupid. I am really disappointed because I had hope. In fact my xu offer is't the best think that I want to have but I am so tiered of this configuration of life. So, anyway I need to sign a contract with XU and then move to Berlin. They will be my ticket to Germany. after some rest and preparations I will proceed looking for managerial position. my plan is to relocate my body, make documents and find another place for work. It will be relatively simple I suppose. In general this day was good but I was nervous because of waiting some answer from wunderflats. I improved some important parts of my portfolio and proceeded working on github article. I will release all this things soon. I want to buy bolshakov.tech and to place my portfolio there. So yes. Another good news that our passports are going to us from Moscow. BLS will receive them soon. After that I need to take my russian passport from embassy and then all will be good.

# 12 September - Tuesday - Yerevan - 348 day of immigration

18.45 Yerevan's time. I signed a contract with The XU. I also had a call with GE and it was quite messy and unelectable. Some adult men were listened to me and was asking questions. It was nice. Besides this I was working on my portfolio and articles. Tomorrow I am going to edit video in the morning and then working on DR SMILE's tasks. Now time works for me and nobody can fire me. I am in safe position. XU can't cancel the offer. Now they should support me with relocation and documents. After that I will select a German embassy that will help me with it. It's interesting that I almost one year abroad and I found a way how to leave Armenia. I will keep this country in my heart forever. They are amazing.

# 13 September - Wednesday - Yerevan - 349 day of immigration

The day was long and nice. I was implementing some stuff for DR SMILE and was working of portfolio. I also need to prepare some code for demonstration to Oxolo company. I will finish with this tomorrow. I am also going to Dentist tomorrow. It will be control checkup after extraction of three teeth. I am quite tired and stuff. I also started doing some sport again. I don't feel anything about it yet, but maybe it will be good thing on long distance. I don't like sport and it's really hard for me to introduce it to my daily life. The weather in Yerevan became cold. It's worse than I expected. 35 degrees have gone and now it's 15 degrees outside. Huge difference isn't it?

# 14 September - Thursday - Yerevan - 350 day of immigration

Today we got visas to Spain. They gave us them for one months. Also we are about to start applying for a working visa to Germany. It will be interesting and challenging thing. I also closed a couple of tasks for DR SMILE which is nice. Honestly this day finished so fast that I don't know what to add. The other thing is that I was in Dentist office and it's good. The first half of the day we were working from Cafe and it's cool. I still cannot understand that I will live in Berlin. It's so weird. I should be honest to you. It was my dream. I grew up on stories about immigrants and I am the same person. It's ridicules.

# 15 September - Friday - Yerevan - 351 day of immigration

Finally today is Friday. I am a bit tiered as usual. I did a lot of work today. I was working on portfolio and other stuff. I decided to translate my two articles written in Russian to English. I also was coding a bit. I also had a conversation with a product manager from General electric. He shared some cool insights to me. In common it's conversation was nice. The day was calm and hard. I am happy that it finished.

# 16 September - Saturday - Yerevan - 352 day of immigration

I visited barber today. It's high probability that I will visit him one more time. After that I need to looking for someone on Berlin. On monday I am going to talk to agency that will help me with documents. I am almost ready for it. It's still a little bit scary. It will be a completely new page for me. I am so exited about immigration to Germany that I cannot stop thinking about it. I will be devastated is something goes wrong. However everything looks good. On monday I will get more information. The next week will be the week of birthdays. My mom, Oleg and Ksusha will become older in one year. At the same time I still learning Spanish and I am sure that I will speak this language without a problem. Please remember this words. I will know four languages at least. Russian as native, English as working, German for living, and Spanish for soul. I think that knowing of many languages is a sigh of high educated person.

# 17 September - Sunday - Yerevan - 353 day of immigration

THis day wasn't nice. I felt bad. My back is in bad condition. It hurts. I need to start doing sport again. I will do it tomorrow morning. It's an important thing. I don't pay enough attention to my body. I am 35 years old and it's the edge when I need to start doing something with it. Additionally I was working a lot on one of my articles. I also changed structure of Holy Theory. I made architectural mistake initially and now It's a time to fix it. Ksusha did a great thing and prepared documents for getting D visa and blue card. She helps me a lot. We also was walking today and was sitting in Syrovarnya. It's an expensive restaurant in the city center.

# 18 September - Monday - Yerevan - 354 day of immigration

After getting thing that I will leave DR SMiLE it becomes harder for me to make tasks. I am almost out of their scope. I can say that I am happy about it. It's not a fact that the next place will be nice. Moreover I don't want to make some ties with them. My plan is still the same: get relocation, resolve some documents' problems and find another place. I want to be a part of that engineering society. Just after relocation I plan to prepare some videos and publish them on youtube. I want to get some proofs about my communicational and presentational skills. I want to be a speaker in conferences and make another step in my career. The life is difficult and in general I see how e everything changes. I also have some observation that non-tech companies create internal systems by their own teams and then migrate to outsources. At the same time other companies that start from outsources migrate to internal teams. My assumption is that nobody can be satisfied by initial design. It's very interesting because it affects us - engineers. It's absolutely different. I think this topic might be valuable for an investigation and maybe dissertation. In general this day was nice. I released another part of holy theory and feel good. I also almost finished working on another demo project that I will add to portfolio website.

# 19 September - Tuesday - Yerevan - 355 day of immigration

THis day was nice. I finally got my second passport in Russian embassy. It was really easy. I also bought a present for Ksusha. I will give her a book and a small bag for little things. The another bad thing happened today. Azerbaijan attacked Artzakh. It's a armenian populated place and argued territory in this region. I got passport and after that a huge crowd blocked Russian embassy. They force russian peacemakers to start doing something in order to stop this attack. Some people already died because of bombs and rockets. So, it's really bad. I am so tiered of that crazy shitty authorities that kill people for nothing. I hope to live in some peaceful place. I now that it is an utopia and almost all countries are involved into wars but still. I am tiered of problems. I want to do business and so. I hate all this shit. Additional bad think is that I have to go back to Russia for D visa to Germany. I also have to register an appointment in Saint-Petersburg. It's bullshit. I am so tiered of all this shit.

# 20 September - Wednesday - Yerevan - 356 day of immigration

First layoffs happened. I lost two members in my team. Ryan and Anton will not work in the team. It's bad for me because I will have to support the majority of managerial tasks that I moved to them. It's huge loss for me. I need to work in this env for the next two months and hopefully I will be in another company. Additionally DRSMILE closed business in Poland. A polish guy destroyed their business there by facebook group. It's really interesting. I am happy that found some place and I will leave the company. Their business is in a bad condition. I don't believe in them because the management doesn't understand how goals should be achieved. It's also interesting. I see this kind of blindness for the first time in my life. It's absolutely crazy bullshit. Despite all this things I feel some satisfaction due to Ryan's leaving. I think that this guy tried to destroy me several months ago. He complaint to management that I work on holy theory and don't work on drsmile tasks. It was an incredible lie. the thing is fair. Also I know that I will never meet him in Berlin. It's cool. I was thinking about it. He is very boring buy and there is nothing to discuss. Also the protests in Yerevan are going on. This situation is scaring me. I don't want to be involved to the tragedy. However I am already here. I expect to see a lot of refugees from Artzakh. I hate wars.

# 21 September - Thursday - Yerevan - 357 day of immigration

Well, the day is almost finished. For a some period of time I tried to understand what I can do in the situation. In simple words - nothing. I am absolutely demotivated to do anything. These people broke a last drop of trust that I had. I expected that layoffs would happen. All those people have to looking for another job on a quite tough market. I don't think that it will be a tragedy. However I still work on my portfolio. This task is extremely important because in the future all this pieces of code will turn into articles. I have a huge plan about it. I also think about resurrection of some very old initiatives and turning them into articles as well. Another point is I need to decide how to start texting articles about management. It's extremely important as well. I need to demonstrate that I am more than engineer. It might be hard. The peak of this activity I want to move to Berlin. I think a lot about this relocation. I really want to leave Armenia and Russia as well. I love Saint-P and my family but the life is harder. I wish to live in normal conditions. Everything I was thinking about in 2015 is much harder to achieve. The war, visa problems, prices, etc. make thing very complex. I even have less change to make a mistake. One fault and I am in the army. The only hope is that the will not make anything like this before president elections 2024. It will be very formal procedure, but after that all blockers will be gone for them. Russian authorities will start doing shit in galaxy's scale. As usual, we will see.

# 22 September - Friday - Yerevan - 358 day of immigration

They kicked me from lead position. It's sad but not a huge problem. I got an appointment to German embassy in Saint-Petersburg. Basically We will flight home soon. It will be interesting because it will be a year since I live outside of the country. I am pissed off of the DR SMILE. It will be hard for me to work for them for about two months more. I will get a vise soon. It will happen. It's very low chance that Germany will reject me. From another side I want and don't want to visit Russia. The situation with the war and other shit is still hard. I accept this risk. Additionally I am happy to be able to see my relatives. I missed my mom, grandmother, aunt. Ksusha's relatives are also very cool people and I will be happy to see them. Basically I will visit three cities: Saint-Petersburg, Rzhev, and Moscow. I am happy about that. Especially it's cool to see my close people before moving to Germany for some huge period of time. Protests in Armenia are still here. Some people were caught and moved to police offices but in general it looks calm outside. Me and Ksusha are going to the city center for having a dinner. Another thing I got an email from my future CTO with a list of technologies and other things. I like this approach. I will have something to recall and train. It's very important for having a relative success in the new Company. I need to be cool there because I decide to start looking for another leading position in February. In two months after possible relocation.

# 23 September - Saturday - Yerevan - 359 day of immigration

I experienced huge pain in my head today. It's something crazy. I wanted to drink a small beer bottle in Hard Rock cafe but I got just Pepsi and burger. In general this day was dedicated to preparations for moving to Germany. I learned how insurance works there and booked a Berlin's hotel for a month. It's necessary for obtaining a visa. I also read something about compulsory health insurance. So, for the beginning I will get a state insurance then I will calculate, maybe commercial one is more reliable for me. I don't know. Also I read something about Berlin in general and made some other preparations. Tickets to Russia are bought. I will got there in the next Saturday. On the next Monday I will go to the visa center in Saint-Petersburg and give them my document's pack. If everything is good I will obtain visa in the end of the next month. It would be amazing. Just after getting a visa I will start preparations for leaving of DR SMILE. I am happy that I got this offer. I cannot work for this company anymore. First I am tiered, secondly the organization changed a lot. It's not a nice place for work anymore. Absence of strategy, plus focus for getting new patients destroys the common and holistic business model. Mainly because of my leaving I don't think about layoffs and that they stole my tech lead position. Do they want me to write some code? It will never happen anymore.

# 24 September - Sunday - Yerevan - 360 day of immigration

I feel headache for the second day. I was thinking about Germany for the whole day. It's interesting. I am excited about it. The only concern i have is that I need to visit Russia. However I called my mother today and told her about my visit. She is happy that it will happen. I didn't see her more than for one year. I could not meet her before my departure after beginning of the mobilization. I will also be glad to see her. Another interesting topic that Yerevan's metro isn't working today. I think that the reason is in protests. Maybe local authorities expected some demonstrations after Pashinyan speech to nation. However nothing happened. The day was calm and normal. Additionally we were walking in the city center today. I think that some tension appears in Yerevan. Authorities waits the first wave of refugees from Artzakh. Some volunteers opened points around the city where everyone can bring some food or clothes for those poor people. war is always a tragedy. I also almost didn't think about DR SMILE today. It's a good sign. I feel much better after getting an appointment. It's super nice. I will go to drink a cup of tea and then watch a series of Friends.

# 25 September - Monday - Yerevan - 361 day of immigration

Today I just was working on my own stuff. I finally back to work on Github article. I finished with the first draft. Tomorrow I will working on text grooming. Additionally I released another part of holy theory. I still working on builder.js sometimes and I almost finished working on static website generator. I want to finish it as soon as possible. During this release cycle I will do it. I also announced the beginning working on the first chapter of my book. I don't want to publish this text but I will update some table of contents of my book. I need to finalize it in a couple of weeks. It will be also interesting. Me and Ksusha also decided when we will start actually learning German. It will be in one months approximately. I need to consume a lot of information because I am going to change my driver license there but practice exam is in German. It will be a problem for me. The forums are filled with articles about it. They all wrote about how it's easy. I don't think so because again I don't know German. I also expect a lot of potential problems with immigration. It'll be hard but also exciting. The only thing is to visit Russia without any incidents. We will land in Pulkovo airport and local border officers are crazy.

# 26 September - Tuesday - Yerevan - 362 day of immigration

the day finished and I am happy about it. I was working on some portfolio stuff today. Besides that I finished some tasks for DR SMILE. The atmosphere is still heavy there. It was a huge shock for everybody. However I organized some activities for Ksushas birthday. I also prepared a present for her. I will do all stuff about that tomorrow. It will be cool, I suppose. In general day was nice but really hard. I also was talking to another HR and they sent me a coding challenge I need to finish. Thursday or Friday are great days for it. We also bought visit to business lounge in Zvartnots airport for Friday. This thing will relax us a bit and help to prepare for flight. Last time I flew from Italy to Yerevan several months ago and it will be an interesting experience. I like to fly. Every time I enjoy the atmosphere and the fact about so fast movement in space. If I had the money and time, I would go get a pilot's license. But it's not a case. I still dream about yacht captain license. It's also my dream. Before that I need to return sport in my life. It's hard to be concentrating on this.

# 27 September - Wednesday - Yerevan - 363 day of immigration

Today is Ksusha's birthday. I presented a book and small purse to her. Additionally I bought flowers. They look nice. I also was in Dentist office today. She fixed another two teeth. It was the last such visit for me before moving to Berlin. I also was coding for whole day despite the absence of mood. I am depressed. I held the first week after layoffs but now I am in worse condition. Maybe I am just tiered and the fact that I need to visit Saint-Petersburgs adds some bad things to my mind. Don't get me wrong, I really want to visit home, but I am also quite scared of crossing the border. Before the war and all that stuff I didn't think about potential problems there, but everything has changed. You know why. In order to fight with depression I started reading some fiction novell about Max from Echo. It's one of my favorite characters. Max Frei is not the best writer, but she described a character that is very close to real me.
