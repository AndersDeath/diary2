# 01 Januar - Montag - Berlin - 468 Tag der Einwanderung

I slept a lot today. It was nice and fair. After that I did some important things, went for a walk for 20 minutes and cleaned mold. Oh fuck the situation with the mold here is horrible. It grows constantly and everywhere. I am tiered of it so much. I event cannot fix it because the building is rotten. The landlord did some cleaning and renovation but in fact the quality of walls, windows, stairs is awful. It's amazingly stupid I would say. I could not expect that such situation is possible in Berlin. It's sad basically. I also updates some important things from my todolist but in general the day was calm and I didn't spend much time of the work. Tomorrow will be different. I will go to the office and try to change my focus to the work. I hope it will be easy because I had enough time for having a rest and starting doing things. Also I decide that I will not drink alcohol this year at all. Additionally I decided to quit from youtube stupid videos. I think that books can replace me some recreation stuff. Instead of youtube videos I will listen to audiobooks. So yes, I will do everything for being better in 2024. I figured out the person that I want to be. So, I need to do some steps for it.

BVG company finally withdraw money from my account for 59 euro ticket. Now I can travel across Germany using all public  transport except high speed trains. It's cool. Also Ksusha got another viewings of apartments. She is cool about it. I am proud of her. Additonally i sent another application for radio tax for her. When I gen both for me and Ksush ID's I can reduce the cost of this tax. It's really good. I spent all day in the office it was quite cold. Another thing that i did a lot of tasks today. I am almost got crazy because of them I am so tiered. At the same time I have to do sport today. It's not fun. However the day was good. I am tiered and a bit annoyed but happy and feel good.

# 03 Januar - Mittwoch - Berlin - 470 Tag der Einwanderung

The first half of the day I spent in the office then I had to go back home because Ksusha was so tiered and didn't want to be alone. It was possible to me and I did it. Also I was working for a whole day on the projects and so. In the evening we had a dinner in one chinese fastfood point where the price is cheap but portions are huge. It's true that if you ever go to some place where a lot of chinese people you can find small restaurants with this cool set up. After that we went to the Berauer strasse and viewed another apartments. I liked the place so it is not so new. At the same time the location is perfect. However we still wait for an answer from another people and have several appointments on this week. I understand that it's hard but we need to find some place. We don't have a choice. It's really important.

# 04 Januar - Donnerstag - Berlin - 471 Tag der Einwanderung

I was working from home today. the weather is much colder than I expected. I was working for a whole day on different tasks and it was nice. Also I viewed an apartment today. The shape of this is quite weird but the location is great. In general I didn't do a lot of things today. I overslept today. However I had an interview today that was nice. I really improved my presentational skills I like it very much. Then I got another invitation for a call with interesting company. I hope to have it next week. The sad news is that one of great owners rejected us. It was a great variant but we were not so good for them. It's sad really. In general it's hard for me that it's so hard to find a place for living in the city. Berlin is harsh. I heard many storied about this. But that was just reflection of somebodies experience. Feeling it by yourself is difficult.

# 05 Januar - Freitag - Berlin - 472 Tag der Einwanderung

The day was busy again. I did a lot of things but I am tiered as well. I updated holy theory and added some words to my next article. The good news that I was selected to two apartments short list. i suppose that soon i will get some answer from both of them and it will be clear if I will have a flat soon. If not I will have to pay for another month living here on Prinzenallee 21. This is nice place but dirty and I don't line attitude of my landlord. It is weird sometimes. So, we also visited sony center. We walked around and it was cool. However the main event is that I entered to two short lists. i really want to fix it as soon as possible.

# 06 Januar - Samstag - Berlin - 473 Tag der Einwanderung

We visited a Frei University library today. It's a great building with cool and modern place. I liked it so much, I am sure that I will come back to that place in the future. We also looked at an apartments that were really nice and I enjoyed the place. I have a hope that we will be selected. The place stays in a cool district and has great transport availability. Additionally I got an invitation to live in one place on Leopoldplatz. It's cool but i am not sure that the place is cool for me. I don't know really. It was the only view that I visited alone. tomorrow we will be on two other places. So, will see. In general the Ksusha's efforts give shoots. She is crazy about this question. Also tomorrow is orthodox christmas, we will not celebrate it but it's a very important tradition.

# 07 Januar - Sontag - Berlin - 474 Tag der Einwanderung

I'm so tiered today. We finally decided to reject contract on leopoldplatz. The place is not so good and I don't like curvy walls in that apartments. We are waiting for two answers from two apartment. I have a hope to be invited to one of them. Will see during the next week. It's really hard. Also we viewed another apartments today. The place is extremely atmospheric but old. I liked the place but Ksusha didn't enjoy it unfortunately. Tomorrow we will have another view of apartments and the day after tomorrow and two days after tomorrow. Yea. We are really focusing on it. Also we wanted to visit one museum but didn't have time and didn't have stamina for it. it's 8pm and I really enjoy to be home. Tomorrow I am going to the office.

# 08 Januar - Montag - Berlin - 475 Tag der Einwanderung

I spent the whole day in the office. In the evening we looked at cool apartments in the nice district. I enjoyed it. I catastrophically don't have time for making things. I cannot find time for all my projects. I have viewings of apartments every fucking day. Event tomorrow I will go to one in the morning, and in the evening we will go check another one together. Also we finally rejected an apartments on Leopoldplatz. The agent didn't send me pictures and he wants us to pay deposing for all 3 months in one payment. It's illegal in Germany. Fuck them. At the same time I have positive thoughts in general. I expect to obtain an apartment at the end of the months. I am so tiered but I feel that my life goes in the proper direction.

# 09 Januar - Dienstag - Berlin - 476 Tag der Einwanderung

In the morning I viewed another apartment. I don't understand what's wrong with Germans. The agent forgot keys and we had to wait for 30 minutes. I didn't have time for it and I just went off. After that I was working for a whole day on different thigns. Tomorrow I need to replace one article in HT project and then the first raw draft will be ready. In the evening we viewed another apartment that are really nice, it's a change that we will be selected. Of course I am not sure. I don't any proves. Anyway I am on it and trying to find a place. Unfortunately it consumes so much time that I cannot do anything for it. I am really waiting for something. I am so tiered of looking for a place. I feel that the end is near me. It's cool.

# 10 Januar - Mittwoch - Berlin - 477 Tag der Einwanderung

I added the final piece of information to my holy theory algorithms thing. This is good. Ksusha went and checked an apartments today. In the evening we went to another place and checked it. After that we got some turkish food. In general I am again don't have time for doing my own things. I hate it and feel bad due to this. I'm trying to do things on time, but in reality the process breaks every time. The immigration process is crazy and it's hard to even find a way to push it. The things just go and I try to adapt my behavior to it. At the same time I had an interview today with one American company for Engineering Manager position. I don't know how it might go because the process in this company is crazy. They want to have 30 minutes interview with HR (it's after the first phone call), then the want to have to 60 minutes engineering interview sessions and after that 4 (SIC!) 60 minutes managerial sessions. I am really jellos. It's crazy that they have so much time for the process.
