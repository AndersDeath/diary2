# 01 December - Thursday - Gündoğan - 63 day of immigration

Today is 2 months since i left Russia. I still feel bad. I really dream about a moment when I can be in good mood and calm. I feel that I am extrimely tiered of the situation. I know that much more people in worse situation that me, but I feel it as it is. I am also extrimely tiered of the working for DR SMile. It seems that I am very close to be burned out. 

Despite the my mood I try to do things in time. I go through my todolist, don't forget about lessons, and try to study something everyday. I try to find stability in my mind, but honestly I feel everything so useless. I don't want live in this shit.

Sometimes I even think about going back to Russia and trying to find job there. Only fear of death holds me from it. I think I need to come up with some strategy for future asap. In other case I will go crazy. 

Only one thing exists - everything will be ok. I believe in it.

# 02 December - Friday - Gündoğan - Turgutreis - 64 day of immigration

It's really cool that we got new jaket for Ksusha today. The thing we had going to Turgutreis for it. But this is no a problem. The problem is absence of jaket. The Turgutreis bus was filled by young studenst of local Gundogan school. Surprisingy the behaived well. Alsot because of the 20 000 000 revenew of DR SMILE I have a half day off. It's really funny, but I am grad to have it anyway. From studying perspective I got rhetorics of story lessons. it's was interesting and quite well. Unfortunately it wa the only thing that I've done today. Finally I posted a new video. It's good becasue I didn't have time for editing it. I like to record all that stuff, it is like therapy for my. Also I had to finish my math lessons and probably I will finish with Portugal ones as well. The probem is that i don't have time for it. Maybe in the future I will come back to them. But now It's imposible. I think I can focus on Ukranian. It's quite easier that absolutly new language that didn't learn before. Also it's more convinient to learn something from the same family. Tomorrow we are going to Bodrum for the last time. we will go to istanbul and then to Yerevan on the next week

# 03 December - Saturday - Gündoğan - Bodrum - 65 day of immigration

The very last weekend in Bodrum has been started. We are going back to Istanbul in the next wednesday. We said good buy to Bodrum today and to Turgutreis yesterday. Tomorrow I will try to record the last video here in Gundogan. Newermind. Today we discussed my new CV. There is something for working. I will change several lines there on the next week. In general today I had a free day. I did something, but mostly not so important. I decided to groom my guthup repositories, but I have a lot of them. I started putting all this stuff to a notion table, but i was tiered of this and decided to make a script. so, now I have 117 repositories, it's too much. tomorrow I will try to proceed working on it.
