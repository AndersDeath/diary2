# 01 July - Saturday - Yerevan - Gyumri- 275 day of immigration

We were in Gyumri today. We bought tickets to local train in advance and used this transport. IT was nice for about 2 hours trip from Yerevan to Gyumri and the same time back. This city is quite old and had name Adrianapol and Leninakan before. This titles are from Russian empire and USSR accordingly. It is quite nice city that is absolutely perfect for one time visit. I don't think that I will go back to the place. We checked several local cafes and restaurants, visited several places of interests and had a good time. I really enjoyed this trip. I made 20000 steps today and my legs are buzzing now. It's crazy. Another nice thing is that I did a lot of duo linguo exercises in train and read several pages of Lord of the rings. I barely have time for reading and sometimes I am really happy to do it. It very relaxes me. I still believe that reading is the best way to train fantasy. You have only words and some mood. All pictures you build in mind by yourself. Yea. This day was nice. I hope that tomorrow will be at least the same. Will see.
