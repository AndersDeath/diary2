# 03 April - Monday - Yerevan - 186 day of immigration

This day was nice. I did a lot of things as usual. Holy theory has been released and I will proceed working on it during the week. I also had a lot of calls today. I had a nice conversation with one Portuguese company but they cannot give me enough money. The rest of the day I dedicated to usual things. Tomorrow I have a lot of plans. It's time to record another video. I need to start doing it. At the same tim I will do some sport because it's time. Very soon I will go to airport and meet Ksusha. She is in a plane now. Fortunately the departure was in time today. the way to the place is quite hard for her. She woke up in Rzhev and drove to Moscow. After that she had to move from bus station to airport through the whole Moscow. I hope landing will be also well.

# 04 April - Tuesday - Yerevan - 187 day of immigration

I slept bad today. I went to the bad quite late because I went to airport in order to meet Ksusha. At the same time I feel how my mood become better. I againt want to write code for DR SMILE. I had a call with NN they decided not to proceed with me. The first call was moved to another day because of hr specialist's sick leave. I hope we will have a conversation the day after tomorrow. Additionally I had a call with Yassir guy. I don't thing that this company is a good fit for me. At the same time it's april but I don't have offers at all. This time a job search goes much more difficult. Maybe I really was wrong and I should go to Germany to some company. it's difficult. At the same time I still extremely tiered of DR SMILE despite the fact of coding desire.

# 05 April - Wednesday - Yerevan - 188 day of immigration

Nothing significant happened today. I feel that I'm tiered of situation again. I would like to immigrate to another place but I cannot do it. every fucking day I work hard on it. It looks like I do something wrong. I maybe need to focus more on performance and publicity. It's so hard to understand. Each case including mine is unique. You really don't know where is that shot that can move you to another position. Sometimes I really start to think about starting own business. It's really hard to understand. It's april outside but I still don't have an offer on a table. It's disgusting. I don't blame anyone at the same time I cannot understand how to crack the system. I hope I will find the way. I don't want coming back to Russia again. I really don't

# 06 April - Thursday - Yerevan - 189 day immigration

I didn't do anything significant today. I was coding a lot. I barely eat today. I was investigating some important things regarding publishing of npm packages. It'll be also a topic for an article. I know that I have significant article dept. I will fix it, I promise. I also had a call wi babbel company. they have a nice conditions for work that is nice. I hope we will proceed talking to them. Tomorrow i will also have a call despite the fact that it's a holiday in Berlin.

# 07 April - Friday - Yerevan - 190 day of immigration

I was programming for whole day. I didn't do anything significate. I had an interview with cheeky HR. She just sent me an invitation yesterday without any connections. It was extremely rude I suppose. They are going to pay few money but have a huge expectations.

# 08 April - Saturday - Yerevan - 191 day of immigration

Today we did nothing. we went for a walk and made around 18000 steps. Also we finally visited Hard Rock cafe. It's such a nice place. there are a lot of interesting artifacts like korn's guitar, guitar of zakk wilde, cher's boots, etc. It's the place where nice music plays. I really like it. We also visited interesting pizzeria that is near Republic Square metro station. If I'm not mistaken it's called Mozzarella. we went to Razdan river and children' railway. I also drunk a bit beer. I usually don't drink it but sometimes it's nice. I like beer in general and had huge problems with it in the past. Luckily I don't have them anymore. It's was a nice free day and I like it. I also did one task on leetcode. I still try to continue solving problems every fucking day. I hope it'll help me. I still don't know. Today life is quite easier.

# 09 April - Sunday - Yerevan - 192 day of immigration

Today we were walking again. We went to SAS food court that is near out previous apartments. Then we walked among tumo center and to huge SKK staduim. After that we visited the armenian henocide monument and went down from hill to dolma garden mall. In general this walk was quite nice. I also created a plan for future vide that I am going to record the next morning. Tomorrow is a holiday in germany and I will not have meetings. I also will have a chance to finish with my routine tasks. from tomorrow I will go back to usual pace. I need to finish a lot of things before vacation. From business things I did some coding thins morning and such things. Now I need only to finish something for holy theory.

# 10 April - Monday - Yerevan - 193 day of immigration

It was a typical monday. The hard endless day. I recorded new sources for the next video. I will start editing tomorrow. I was coding a bit and I went back to business questions and trainings. I feel how it became boring. I mean programming questions. Sometimes I need relax. However I published another version of holy theory. I every day try to add improvements to it. The weather in Yerevan isn't so good today. It's raining outside and the atmosphere is quite depressive. I really want to sleep for whole day. So, I will go and do some sport right now. It's a time.

# 11 April - Tuesday - Yerevan - 194 day of immigration

I feel quite depressive today. It's not a first time, but I totally hate this kind of things. Russian government created new law that gives them an option of sending online letters with order to arrive to military service. even if you miss it for some reasons, you must go. Repressions are still here. It makes me feel uncomfortable. It's really bad. I also was coding for whole day. Maybe I will try to get the second job. I want to have more money and opportunities. I/m investigating this things. The job searching process is extremely slow this time. One year ago I already had two offers for three months. It's hard. I hope that I will find another place. I still don't know if it's possible. Apparently every time when I get thins kind of news I feel bad. Much worse than usual. anxiety feeling is constantly with me. I really want to just live.

# 12 April - Wednesday - Yerevan - 195 day of immigration

Today I was coding for whole day and it was quite cool. I also did some coding trainings. unfortunately I had to work on DR SMILE's tasks. I did one minor improvement for eleventy though. I also was reading a lot about new law that turns all men in Russia to slaves. Military slaves I would say. This is ridiculous. Sometimes I really cannot understand them. They are crazy bastards. I think that Russia and our society are very close to revolution. This kind of shit is impossible to handle. I hope that situation will be changed soon. It's april outside and it's means that 6 months of good weather are in front of us. It's good time for protests. I don't understand who will lead this protest but I think that something is cooking by someone. I think that it will be reach people that can sponsor the protests. It will be very soon. I hope that this shit will be resolved in this year. In other case this shitty putin will be in power until his death. Unfortunately he is quite healthy person.
