# 01 August - Tuesday - Yerevan - 306 day of immigration

So, Today I had lot of call about everything. DR SMILE hired a freelancer that should help me with implementation of the new patient portals. THis is a KPI for my team. I also a call with some potential employer. It's General Electric. I don't expect anything from them. The situation is that I still work on my portfolio. I do it really hard. I need to finish 3 project in 3 weeks. It's quite challenging process. However I believe in myself. Everything will be good. I think you also see how my mood changes after Ksusha returned. Depression went out. The mood is much better but I am also very tiered.

# 02 August - Wednesday - Yerevan - 307 day of immigration

The weather today is crazy. It's 22:47 o'clock and 27 degree Celsius outside. It's heavy. I had a tech interview with one company today. I don't expect anything from them. I barely could think. At the same time I will have another call with autohaus company. It's weird place for work but still. I also need to start doing something with my mental condition. Surely after Ksushas return I feel my better, however I am not so stable. There are many reasons, including necessity of preparations for immigrations, current tasks in DR SMILE and many other things. I try to do my best.

# 03 August - Thursday - Yerevan - 308 day of immigration

The heat is killing me. the weather is still extreme. I still working on my portfolio. I updated the main page of the project. I started getting fat. It's something new because I kept my body relatively fit. Things changed. Tomorrow I am going to clinic to my dentist. He should extract 3 tooth and screw one new prothesis. I hope that it will be latest procedure this kind to me in Yerevan. I am really going to leave this country at the end of the year. Probably it will be Germany. you know that I prepare documents for freelance vise and have interview with new potential jobs. It's funny that the majority of the are from Munich but I want to be in Berlin. Germany is a great place for preparations before moving to the US. Finally I want to settle there. We want to it actually.

# 04 August - Friday - Yerevan - 309 day of immigration

I got surgery today. It wasn't so cool. Surgeon installed one prosthetic and removed some bads with shit. Also I got perforation between mouth and nose areas. My nose started bleeding after surgery. It was something absolutely new for me. I never experienced this shot before. I feel relatively ok now. Pain is not so heavy. At the same time I need to do specific procedures. The first part of the day was dedicated to programming. I tried to do all tasks that are in dept on me. Finally I did it and now all is good. I also was invited to the final interview with company tracify. It's cool. I didn't expect that. Even if their conditions will be not good I happy to be on the final step. Also I gather documents for freelance visa. this is still my main option. I am not sure about working visa and such. Maybe everything will be good. The mood is better that before. It's good. I feel some fewer and it's obviously because of today's procedures.

# 05 August - Saturday - Yerevan - 310 day of immigration

I feel good today. The don't feel any bad stuff after surgery. Yesterday it was hard. Nevermind. We were in Gurmenia today again. The crousanne, I don't know how to write down this word, was nice. I also checked my eyes and tomorrow I will get new glasses. My current ones are nice, but a bit old. Tomorrow Ksushas newie and Sister Julia will come to us. They want to spend a nice days here in Yerevan. We will support them but will not be babysitters. The weather is extremely hot here. I handled it better today that usually buy still. I also try to find some stamina for working on portfolio. It's not so easy. However I try to do my best. Despite the result that will be with my immigration I need to prepare some real cases of my work. At the same time I do investigation how to write great layouts. I need to be more focused on really front-end part that on programming in general. this is my area of expertise. I need to remember about it. Being in focus is crustal. I cannot afford spreading my attention to not related topics anymore. Surely I need to grow as programmer and manager. Especially as manager. Front-end and management should be my way to wealthy life.

# 06 August - Sunday - Yerevan - 311 day of immigration

The day was nice. I am quite tiered. The heat was extremely huge as usual. Julia and Arsenii has come to us. We were in the city center and went to Sirovarnya restaurant. It was good and tasty. I also got new eye glasses. It's was also cool. I also was editing the letter for German authorities about my position. My mood was good. At the same time gums are in pain. Today is just third day after operation. Obviously I still don't feel good. In general I don't have a lot of thoughts for sharing with you. I am tiered and this is shitty. I need to finish 

# 07 August - Monday - Yerevan - 312 day of immigration

Today I had a call with Tracify company. It was the final call before rejection of offer. I don't know what will be the result. I'm a bit exited due to their desire to have a guy in Netherlands. It's really cool. I only need to relocate to that place. After that I will find a job in place. It will be not a problem. So, It was nice talk about technologies and about nothing. Let's see what will be the result. The guy from booking fucked up us. I had to make 3 call to GB via Skype and ask for a cancellation. I suppose these people are fraudsters. It's sad but fortunately we found another apartments on airbnb. Julia and Arsenii will check tomorrow it. This is very very good. I like to be with them but they always want to have some attention. I like it but I cannot do it. I need to work.

# 08 August - Tuesday - Yerevan - 313 day of immigration

The day was absolutely crazy. I just finished and its 9pm on my watches. This is crazy day. I was programming and also had a call with german lawyer that shared some thoughts with me how to obtain permit in Berlin. So, It's really a challenge I think. Absolutely crazy. However I need to try obtaining it. It's important. Unfortunately freelance contract of DR SMILE is illegal and cannot proceed working with them. It's bad. At the same time maybe I will get some cool offer. I still don't know. Will see. Now I just need to have a rest. Julia and Arsenii moved to their apartments which is good for me. I will sleep well today. Finally. My gums are still in pain. I hate all these surgery bullshit. I dream about finishing this process.

# 09 August - Wednesday - Yerevan - 314 day of immigration

So, Today I had 2.5 hours tech interview with some company. It wasn't so good and nice. I suppose that it was just waste of time. However I like to have interviews because every time I can check the level of my knowledge and maybe check how I can do things. Especially I like discussions that might happen during the conversation. Also I payed all bills today. It's nice. Additionally I got a message from Tracify company and they want to talk to me. I don't know what they want from me but it might be some negotiations. I don't know. I am so tiered from the immigration situation that I don't care anymore. I just do something and try to achieve the goal. I've training in different areas for almost two years. I need some calm time. I need to have some stable time. I also hope to find a place for building the new life. It should happen. I believe in me.

# 10 August - Thursday - Yerevan - 315 day of immigration

After 7 months of interview and call I finally got the first job offer. Company Tracify wants me to join. I think that it's good because they offered me relocation from start. this is really cool. I can select Germany or Netherlands which is also cool. However the salary is quite small. It's bad. My inclme will be less that I get in DR SMILE. IT will be more that I got in the beginning of working for them but still. So, I am very glad about it. Maybe, there is a chance I will apply this offer and relocate to Netherlands. However Munich is also a choice. I don't know what to do yet. I also was in dentist cabinet this morning. I discussed treatment of a tooth using microscope. It might save it. I would be happy to have this tooth. At the same time it might be better to just remove it and don't come back to the topic. I don't know yet. The weather is crazy. It's 42 degrees outside. Tomorrow will be hotter. In general it's hard to live in this conditions. Crazy.

# 11 August - Friday - Yerevan - 316 day of immigration

So I am about to refuse that company offer. The 70k is absolutely unacceptable for me. If I want to have some shares I will get 65k per year. It's really tough. Unfortunately I have to reject this offer. I want to grow and don't want to make mistakes. It's important for me. At the same time I decided to try moving to Germany by myself. I am scared about it but I want to try. From another part I was working for a whole day. I scheduled an appointment in terapist dentist. She will help me on Tuesday. MY surgeon removed stitches today. It's nice. At the same time I still have perforation between mouth and nose. I hope that this hope will close by itself by the end of the week. It's hard stuff but still. Tomorrow we will drive to Sevan lake and to other cool places of interests in Armenia. Julia and Arseniy want to see more. At the same time I didn't drive a car for two months and will be happy to do it.

# 12 August - Saturday - Yerevan - 317 day of immigration

We was driving in Armenia. We were in Khor Virap, Sevan lake, Garni, Azat reservoir. I fucked up today. I fell asleep when I drove the car. It was horrible. However everything went well and I didn't hurt anyone. I was sleeping very bad last night. In general I did nothing today and had a rest for a whole day. I liked it. I really want to sleep. I need to find a balance again. This is important. I also tried to teach Arsenii to swim on his back. It was hard for him. By the way I rent a Chrysler car today. I really like american vehicles. They are usually very nice inside and outside as well. The weather was nice and cool. I burnt probably. But the main point of today that I need to balance my life. Tomorrow I will start doing it. I need it. It's time. P.S. I swam today. Last time it was one year ago in Egypt. It's fucking weird. I was in Egypt.

# 13 August - Sunday - Yerevan - 318 day of immigration

The day was nice, I did a lot of things. I returned the car to the rental company, visited my barber, and so. Today is out wedding anniversary. WE are a family for two years today. It's very cool moment I would say. I also wrote some code and read book. I tried to be calm and just had a rest. I need to have a reboot. My mind is tiered, body doesn't work well. I have same waste fat in body and so. I also stopped practice meditation that is a shame. I don't like myself last several months. I'm so concentrated on problems that I lost a balance. My mental and physical systems are not good. I need to do something with it. I was so scared yesterday because of incident with a car that I strongly decided to change my attitude to everything. Tomorrow I will start...

# 14 August - Monday - Yerevan - 319 day of immigration

I installed Photoshot for Ksusha today. She is not so good in this busineess. I also did a lot of different things for DR SMILE. It was nice and cool. For example i dived into Elastic Container Service. It was cool. I also had a call with XU company. It was a last tech talk to a person. I don't know what will be the result but I will start a process of obtaining Spanish Shengen visa. I need to get it in order to come Germany and get some local visa. It's a time. I feel fear and other bad feelings. It's really scary stuff. Tomorrow I will go to Ineco bank. I need some special papers for embassy. After that I will got to my dentist. I need to treat one of my bad teeth. Maybe she will safe it for me. I hope. I also starting preparing some basis for getting a vacation. I feel bad I am so tiered.

# 15 August - Tuesday - Yerevan - 320 day of immigration

So guys. this day was again crazy. There is no balance yet. Today I got papers in Ineco. I need them for getting a visa. I also visited dentist. She started saving tooth. Also I was programming for whole day and tried to do maximum number of task. Also I had a strange talk with Autohaus. That people were strange I didn't get their questions and other things. It was stupid. I am again extremely tiered. It looks I will never peace. This immigration stuff is very hard. Emotionally I've almost done. I will go to sleep soon and I am happy about it. The day was good but hard.

# 16 August - Wednesday - Yerevan - 321 day of immigration

Today I was at dentist cabinet. She found the fourth channel in my tooth. This is nice because it will save it. I almost sad good buy to it. Also I had a call with Belinda from Tracify. She was nice and I also told her about what I want to have. So, we will be not have an agreement I think. Anyway I am about to start asking for a visa to Spain. I want to use it for visit Berlin and ask for a freelancer visa. I almost got all documents. I need to prepare myself for some important calls because I still need to get letter of intent from Berlin. I want to be there and it's why it's really important. Tomorrow I will go to Arabkir office and get registration on my permanent residency permit. I also need to get social security number. It's important. Another part is that I will got to print documents for  a visa this weekend. It's crazy how many paper I need to use for it. The was broke everything I had before and now we. As we I mean honest people from Russia need to collect tons of papers and document in order to proof that we are not pieces of shit. Fucking Putin ruined everything. At the same time I meditated today and it was great. I felt the same emotions like I experienced on Phuket island last time. It was before the war and it was the last month before Covid pandemic. I feel it like it was in last century but in fact it was just four years ago.

# 17 August - Thursday - Yerevan - 322 day of immigration

So, Today I got registration address in my permanent residency. Also I got another social card with different social number. So, I was working on interesting stuff for a whole day. Sometimes I cannot believe that I still work in Holy Theory. honestly I don't like this name anymore, but I will use it for a while. I finally see the end of adding description to training in HT. This is incredible because I am extremely tiered of all these process. it's very important and I need to do it but anyway. After that I can start programming shell for operating all that information. I spent a lot of time every day on investigation of nextjs. I suppose that it's the main tool for "fullstack" per say development. I also work on my portfolio in parallel and portal I working on is written using nextjs. The code is quite messy, but it's not so bad at the same time. I work on hard things but after that I will take easier tasks to work. I need to demonstrate my front-end skills and it's not necessary to do huge layouts. I can just create interesting animations and some tricky beautiful things. Tomorrow is Friday and I am happy about that. I will go to dentist in the morning and to surgeon in the middle of the day. All other time I will do my tasks and try to be happy. Additionally guys, the september is very close. It means that the first year of my living outside of Russia is very very close.

# 18 August - Friday - Yerevan - 323 day of immigration

Today I visited my dentist and surgeon. The first doctor fixed my tooth which is cool. But Surgeon wasn't on place. Moreover he forgot to tell me this. Fortunately I got guarantee talon for my prosthetic. The rest of the day I was programming, working on portfolio, and Drsmile stuff. We will go to BLS on tuesday and apply for a visa to Spain. Unfortunately this is the only way to get a visa to Europe for us. We are going to fly to Istanbul and the to Madrid. After being there we will go to Berlin. The design was made. It's hard and very scary to do. I also don't know how to resolve problem with DR SMILE. They can just fire me. It's absolutely real situation. It would be very very bad. At the same time I would like to proceed working for them. And after that find another working place in Berlin. I think it will be real and achievable. After that shit we can start thinking about the US. Finally I want to immigrate there.

# 19 August - Saturday - Yerevan - 324 day of immigration

I got sick today. I eat something bad yesterday. I had fever for whole night. I eat medications. So, I am in the bad for whole day. When I told that I want to have a free day I didn't mean that. At the same  time  I feel much better now. It's about 8pm o'clock. I also learned Spanish again today. I still try to study it because I just like it. Maybe it will give me some benefits. I don't know. It's really hard for me write. The brain is fucked by this poisoning.

# 20 August - Sunday - Yerevan - 325 day of immigration

Today I feel much better. It was just poisoning, not more. We tried to do some cool stuff today but for some reasons the day was absolutely boring. However we went fo a walk. That was nice. Also we were in the city center. I didn't feel perfect and my mood is awful today. I try to be calm but it's hard. The only cool thing today is that I finally finished with updating and adding descriptions to training in Holy Theory project. It was annoying and long process. I am cool. I finished. Tomorrow I will release the final stuff about it. It's cool. At the same time I will have an interesting call with one company. I don't know what they want to tell me but it might be an other offer. If conditions are good it will fix a lot of problems with immigration for us.

# 21 August - Monday - Yerevan - 326 day of immigration

Ksusha felt really bad. She got poisoned like me and she vomited for all night. I was really scared by her condition. Surely I slept bad but it's ok. I tried to help her between getting nap. I also went to pharmacy this morning. fortunately Armenia has absolutely the same medication freedom like Russia has. It's possible to buy basis medication without prescription. It's really good. After that I was coding for a whole day. I had a call with xu company. They will probably offer me a position and relocation. It's really cool. By the way, Ksusha feel good now. All this hell has been finished. I also was in print center today on Republic square. I am a client of Maria, she is an owner of that copy center. It's interesting that it is built just in the metro station hall. It's quite different. I spent 15000 dram which is a big sum. It's about 3600 rub or 36 euros. It's expensive for just printing stuff. Tomorrow we are going to BLS. I need to apply the visa and then wait for two months which is crazy I believe. It's another backup variant for us. Maybe the offer will be nice and I will agree on it. I don't know yet. it will know about it later. At the same time I don't expect this offer because it's absolutely blurry thing. Anyway I am good today and did a lot of things. I will go to sleep shortly. It's  23:21 o'clock. 

# 22 August - Tuesday - Yerevan - 327 day of immigration

Today we took our documents to BLS. So, the process has been started. If we get visas, we can try to move to Berlin. This city is basically our main goal. From documents perspective I need only to get latest letter of intent and then I can ask for this status in Europe. What will be further I don't know. I hope that everything will be good. It's hard to predict. I am no a Vanga and can't see the future. At the same time I try to do my best in preparation of documents and other important things. We are very close to the obtaining that important goal. Also we spent very little time in BLS because we actually successfully got slots. At the same time the hall was almost empty. I hope that spanish embassy will process our documents quick. It's crucial part for having good mood. Additionally I've been waiting for the second passport here. It should be ready soon. I hope that I will get it normally and without problems later. I am a bit afraid of crazy Russian government. I hope they will keep my passport for some time until I will be able to get it. It's interesting and it's also something for the future. Nobody knows what will happen.

# 23 August - Wednesday - Yerevan - 328 day of immigration

I visited a Podolog today. She treated my heels. My brother's birthday was yesterday. it's nice and texted to him. Honestly I feel huge break with family. It's hard. All other time I was fighting with laziness. It was hard to work today. I did my best but it wasn't easy. So, now I feel better but still want to sleep and do nothing. In general nothing happened today. I overslept and just worked. The shot walk is waiting for me. Me and Ksusha will go to the city center shortly. The first year of immigration is very close. I will celebrate it. It's higher chance that i will do it in Yerevan.

# 24 August - Thursday - Yerevan - 329 day of immigration

Everything is going well. I had an interesting call with one company today that is looking for an engineer. This company actually help people with resting apartments. Even more. Some people gives special documents for getting residency permit. It looks like we will get thins opportunity and rent our first Berlins apartments this way. I like it. The only problem is getting a visa. If something goes wrong we will need to ask for a visa again and again. I hope that everything will be good. I don't know but I hope. At the same time I am going to a vacation next week and I am absolutely happy about that. I am tiered of everything and need to have some rest. Company that I was talking to yesterday refused me. I don't know why because their process is so shitty that they use automatic responses. Fuck them. Another interesting piece of news that Russia becomes more and more fail state.

# 25 August - Friday - Yerevan - 330 day of immigration

I actually got an offer from XU company. It looks quite good and I suppose that it will be good opportunity for me. I need to understand what I really want. I want to move to Europe. It's a fact. At the same time I don't want to loose money. Xu offered me 80k per year. It's not so much but still good. It will be hard to live in Berlin with such salary, but I will have a motivation for going forward. At the same time I will have an interview on Monday with Wonderflat engineer. It's tech lead position that would be more attractive for me that something else. I don't want put everything on it but still. At the same time I have much more interesting project in DR SMILE and for the first time since I started working as a tech lead I enjoy the project. All others were sucks and I couldn't do things well. At the same time I have good people around and can plan something. Also I want to cash my equities and it's not so clear for me how to organize that payment well. I definitely need to put this money on Armenian account and then to try move them to the new German one. Anyway it's not so important for now. My vacation has been started. I will have a nice week without DRSMILE which is nice. I enjoy it a lot.

# 26 August - Saturday - Yerevan - 331 day of immigration

This day was good. We were waling and got cheat meal that I really like to have. For instance we were in SAS food court and got pancakes with nuttella and fruits. I really like it. After that we were walking to a new restaurant on Bagramyan avenue. It was nice. There we calculated shares plan that XU proposed to me. It actually not so cool. However it might be good in the future somehow. I don't know. The we were walking to Cascad and just enjoyed a view to Ararat mountains. After that we moved home. I also did some improvements for my portfolio website which is extremely important right now. I still remember about projects that are abandoned. I remember about sharenium that I use on daily basis. Another important project was a readme reactjs application. I also don't have time for it but I still remember about my plans. I want to make it as a part of my portfolio.
