# 01 July - Saturday - Yerevan - Gyumri- 275 day of immigration

We were in Gyumri today. We bought tickets to local train in advance and used this transport. IT was nice for about 2 hours trip from Yerevan to Gyumri and the same time back. This city is quite old and had name Adrianapol and Leninakan before. This titles are from Russian empire and USSR accordingly. It is quite nice city that is absolutely perfect for one time visit. I don't think that I will go back to the place. We checked several local cafes and restaurants, visited several places of interests and had a good time. I really enjoyed this trip. I made 20000 steps today and my legs are buzzing now. It's crazy. Another nice thing is that I did a lot of duo linguo exercises in train and read several pages of Lord of the rings. I barely have time for reading and sometimes I am really happy to do it. It very relaxes me. I still believe that reading is the best way to train fantasy. You have only words and some mood. All pictures you build in mind by yourself. Yea. This day was nice. I hope that tomorrow will be at least the same. Will see.

# 02 July - Sunday - Yerevan - 276 day of immigration

I started learning fastapi today. It's python's library that help to do simple api's. I really want to learn this language despite the fact that I hated it before. Anyway I need to push my brain to think and analyze a new information. This is important. I also prepared some materials for the future test task that I need to finish withing the next two days. I will wake up much earlier because of it. The next week will be hard because I really need to do much more than usual. First of all I need to finish a lot of DR SMILE's tasks. Second of all I need to be prepared to interviews. And finally I need to increase a holy theory developing pace. Now it's silly. I am not satisfied by it. At the same time we will live in another apartments soon and this is amazing. The rest of the day we were walking and went shopping. I bought shower gel and eyeglass frame online. It will be here soon and I will go to optical shop and do new glasses. My current onces are not so good anymore. 

# 03 July - Monday - Yerevan - 277 day of immigration

So, I was investigating python Fast Api framework, react flow and some other things. I did it because I need to finish some tasks soon. At the same time I had a nice conversation with Fedor head of engineering. I asked some questions and got some answers. I have something to think right now. I am very tiered today and feel lack of energy. I cannot explain what happened but I feel bad. Maybe tomorrow I will be better I don't know. Right now the life is not so nice as before. But before it also wasn't so nice. Sitting in the place that you don't want to sit is sucks. Every time when I think that I am ok I understand that actually not. Shitty shit is still here. I hate it. I want my life to be changed to better direction. Doctoflix didn't answer anything to me. It's absolutely disappointment moment. I expected nice attitude but I see that they are shit.

# 04 July - Tuesday - Yerevan - 278 day of immigration

Today I had two shitty interview that I think it was waste of time. I am in bad mood for the last days. So, I was programming for whole day. I still tried to fin ways how to finish with test task for one company. Tomorrow is the latest day when I can do it. I need to wake up earlier that usual for this purposes. Flow framework looks very interesting. I hope that tomorrow I will finish with it and switch to python back. Now I just want to have a rect and do nothing for a couple hours.

# 05 July - Wednesday - Yerevan - 279 day of immigration

I'm extremely tiered today. I slept horrible. It was headache and I was able to sleep only after taking a pill. For whole day I was fighting to nextjs framework. It was hard and annoying thing. I needed to do it in order to make a coding test for one of the companies. I hope everything will be good. I also had two interviews today. HTe first one is with unpredictable result and the second one was just waste of time. Also I know that our backend developer Anton will leave the company soon. It's bad because he's quite smart and knows everything about the system. It'll be huge lost of the team and for the company in general. He's absolutely demotivated by company's behavior. It's crazy but company does everything to loose him. Now I will go and have dinner. after that I just want ot have a smooth and lazy evening. Will see.

# 06 July - Thursday - Yerevan - 280 day of immigration

I was coding for whole day. It was a hell. I also lost a lot of time this morning in dentist clinic. It was also horrible. I almost finished with some test task that one company asked me to do. I will send it to them tomorrow. I also need to finish some important drsmile tasks. It will be tomorrow. I don't want to thing about it now. Tomorrow I will go to the new apartment. My landlord will give me keys and on Saturday we will move to that place. I'm exacted really. It'll be my first long term home here. This is amazing I'm really tiered. I also finally will get teeth on Monday. It's cool. It was a long journey. Now i will go and have a rest.

# 07 July - Friday - Yerevan - 281 day of immigration

I got keys for my new apartments today. We are going to that place tomorrow. I met landlord and did all paper and other type of work. I send another test task in the morning. I wish to get a feedback soon. The rest of the day I was programming and tried to resolve different problems. last two weeks are crazy. I barely can find time for a lot of things. I still cannot do video about Barcelona. IT's shit. When we got internet at new home I will do it. Another thing is that I like my current apartment much more. There is more space and more rooms and bedroom huge. It's sad. But I cannot afford them.

# 08 July - Saturday - Yerevan - 282 day of immigration

Today we moved to another apartments. This thing happened smooth and we did everything in time. Also we decided trying to be on mobile internet because the home one here is quite expensive. Armenia is't cheap country in this sense. We also visited one local mall and bought some important equipment. It's another part because now I feel some root that grow from me into Armenia. We also discuessed possible next steps for relocation. there is nothing easy. It will be hard. I still don't want to live in Russia. I hate everything that happens there. It's horrible place for living. Authorities don't think about people. The only importance is their reputation and money. I hate everything like this. Because of them my life ruined and confused. I hate it as well. Newermind. I updated holy theory today significantly. I will focus on thing tomorrow. I still work on the project although i don't feel excitement about this every day.

# 09 July - Sunday - Yerevan - 283 day of immigration

So, It was the first calm day for a long time. We went for a walk despite the huge today's heat. It's about 36 degrees outside. It's really really hard. I feel like I'm in Dubai. Yerevan is extremely hot city in Summer. It's so unusual. Maybe in the future I will be adapted but now It's really hard. At the same time I was coding for some time today. It was also hard because I feel so tiered about everything. I try to improve myself and so but it's hard. I'm in completely different reality then I was before. It's also hard to admit. I try to do my best but... you know guy it's hard. At the same time I can plan something now. It's cool. Again. another confusing notes.

# 10 July - Monday - Yerevan - 284 day of immigration

I finally got new teeth today. I have it for the last 2 hours haven't got yet how it is. I feel weird. It feels like some external piece of something in my mouth. I need some adaptation. It's very unusual. So I will go to another doctor soon. Tomorrow I will probably get my new eyeglass frame. I really don't see well in my current glasses. It should help I suppose. Anyway Ksusha found clinic that has dentists and ophthalmologist. I will schedule and appointment there. I also had a hard interview today with some company. It was humiliating waste of time. I didn't feel so bad for a very long time. Hate this shit. Tomorrow will be the another difficult day. I don't want to do anything.

# 11 July - Tuesday - Yerevan - 285 day of immigration

The second day with new teeth or the first full day with them. So it's cool but my gums still hurt. ALso I was coding as usual. I cancelled one interview today because it's lottery. I don't want to work for this type of companies. I also got rejection from company that asked me for coding challenge. Those douchebags event didn't provide a comment what was wrong. I am upset of it. In general I got several rejections and it destroys me. I am even in some depression. I will try to admit it. It's really sad. The cool thing is that I received glasses frame. I will make new glasses soon.

# 12 July - Wednesday - Yerevan - 286 day of immigration

Today I was working for whole day as usual. Fortunately today I had two nice interviews and one feedback from company that rejected me. I also was coding for the hal of the day which helped me to come back to normal condition. This is nice I think. Tomorrow I am going to another dentist for consultation. I need to proceed teeth treatment. I need to remove another three ones and then add veneers. It will be the latest step of my pain. In general today all is good. Tomorrow will be better I hope.

# 13 July - Thursday - Yerevan - 287 day of immigration

I visited another Dentist today. It looks like I will spend much more time treating my teeth. This is really sad. However I can normally eat now. I was coding today heavily. Everything went well I just extremely tiered. I also had a call with one company that is called Okno about relocation. Unfortunately they don't have anything specific for me. I cannot say that they can help me. It's sad. Also I decided to combine all reactjs/nextjs projects into one. I really think about startup visa to some country. Really cool if I can relocate to the US directly. HOwever it's another story. I need to make MVP and then ask for a visa and try to find some accelerator. Currently I don't know what to do exactly. Situation is worse that I expected.

# 14 July - Friday - Yerevan - 288 day of immigration

I didn't do anything significant today. I just finish with some coding and that's it. I also mad of internet connection. It's so bad that I am surprised of it. I also had two interviews today. The first one was with some startup from Germany and one addition with another company. Doctorflix finallly rejected me. It was long waiting. i also started thinking about creation of startup and moving by startup visa. I think it's possible but much harder. I think that it's difficult because I don't have an experience in it at all. Another shot that I am afraid of it. It's huge move. The final thing is that we experienced absence of electricity again.

# 15 July - Saturday - Yerevan - 289 day of immigration

Mission impossible was not so interesting. It was usual movie with Tom Cruse. Today I prepared money and documents for applying for another passport. I am going to rus embassy on monday. Additionally we were on Vardavar lake in Yerevan. I found one account on Instagram that offers SUP board training. I really want to try myself in it again. I think I will text to these people and schedule a visit. Dentist that I found on the internet proposed treatment plan for me. I need to think about it and then continue this. I need to finish some procedures and then I can do venires. So, it was quite productive day I am really tiered and only thing I want to just lie down and have a rest. Tomorrow is Vardavar. It's local holyday when people pour water on each other. it means that I will be at home for whole day. It's fun but not for me.

# 16 July - Sunday - Yerevan - 290 day of immigration

Today is Vardavar, I was sitting at home for whole day. I only went out for a 30 minutes to Wildberries to take a clothes drier. We also watched two episodes of Friends. It was funny and well. At the same time I experienced deep depression today. The situation with relocation is worse day by day. I trapped here in Yerevan due to huge queue in German embassy. The waiting list for a visa is about 10 months. It's hard. I need to find another way to immigrate. Ksusha bought a guide describes how to immigrate to Germany by freelance visa. Moreover there is a way to ask for a vise from Germany itself. It's really possible way to leave the country. In addition I will work on startup visa and seeking for some ways to immigrate to the US directly. It's hard situation. The war continues more that 500 days. Putin is still crazy as he was. The ruble is more and more silly. Russian economy is going down. There is no future. Fucking Putin and his fucking friends do everything for throwing us to a hell pit.

# 17 July - Monday - Yerevan - 291 day of immigration

Today I had a long journey to Russian embassy. Stupid council whants to have all application in uppercase I filled mine wrong. Because of that I had to go back home rewrite the application and then go back to embassy. It was crazy. I also had several interviews today that destroyed me. I feel so tiered. Ksusha made bleaching and her teeth are in pain now. In general it was crazy day. I had immigration consultant, many drives in taxi, several calls and finally I wrote huge email to my potentional employer. It was crazy day I really want to just die. But I will go and have some rest. Crazy things happen.

# 18 July - Tuesday - Yerevan - 292 day of immigration

Today I was coding for a whole day. I got a chance to talk to Engineering manager position. I am really exited about it. I also had three calls with different people and two of them were absolutely transparent in terms of my relocation problem. I really need to be in Berlin if I want to get that job. It's too hard. So, because of that we (me and ksusha) decided to work on freelance visa in Germany and investigate how to get enterprinershpt visa to Netherlands. This is an only problem. At the same tim I decided to focus again on personal brand. this is the very supportive thing if I want to be rich. I work on it. Also Ksusha feels much better after bleaching. 

# 19 July - Wednesday - Yerevan - 293 day of immigration

I started working on portfolio today. I need to do it because I want to get a visa to Germany. I basically just need it. Actually I was coding for whole day. I also remember yesterdays conversations with HR's that were honest to me and the only struggle for getting job is my place. It's huge problem that I am not in EU. So, we decided to find another way. At the same time I got a phone call from surgeon. He also offered me 10% discount for his service. Yesterday an incident happened in clinic. I arrived in time but a woman told me that I made a mistake and my doctor was on vacation. So, it was a lie and I went home with bad mood. Anyway I will go to this surgeon in two weeks for extraction of three another teeth. It's important to treat them because it's real problem. I need to remove all potential teeth problems.

# 20 July - Thursday - Yerevan - 294 day of immigration

It was nice day. There a sad piece of news. Suman who is a backend developer in my team will be fired. His probation period is almost finished. I received bad feedback about him. I cannot do it anything. Management made a design. I also pass some cognitive test from one company that is in my funnel. In general this day was quite cool and I just did things. I also prepared some documents for OVIR because I am going to this place tomorrow morning. I need to get a registration. Also I started some preparations for immigration. I sent a bunch of letters to different people. I hope that I will be able to gather all documents in time. It would be nice. Also the lion escaped in Berlin and police asked people to be at home. Another stuff that laws in Russia become crazier and crazier. The fucking morons is continuing to destroy my country. I hate them really. All things that they do are extremely stupid. It's interesting reflection of crime.

# 21 July - Friday - Yerevan - 295 day of immigration

It's friday. I'm exhausted. I brought my permanent residence card to passport table in order to add registration to this. I also had a lot of meetings and now I only want to sleep. It was hard friday. At the same time I thought a lot about the next week. I will have a several important calls and meetings. Enough about that. Yesterdays evening I was on Barbie movie. It was absolutely Hollywood stuff. However it was fun I spent my time with some value. Neverthenless. I'm so tiered that I only can is to sleep.

# 22 July - Saturday - Yerevan - 296 day of immigration

Today I groomed some deals. I sent requests for letters of recommendation for asking a visa. We decided to try our luck in Germany. I started doing a task for liqid company. Even if they don't approve my solution I will put it to my portfolio. I will also reuse this code for my own portfolio website. I also try to break my habits and to correct my way. I again started thinking about freelance career. Maybe it worth, I don't know. It is a quite unstable way and it bothers me. I also thinking about startup. SO many ways and so little time. It's awful. From another side I became stronger and maybe smarter. Sometimes I think that I can do everything just because of all challenges. All that interview tought me how to present myself. All code challanges made me just smarter and I had to use some technologies that I didn't want to use before. The bad thing is that it all adds wrinkles and gray hair. Another hard thing is that Ksusha is going to Russia for a week tomorrow. I will go to railway station and they she goes to Gyumri. The flight from this city to Moscow is much cheaper that from Yerevan.

# 23 July - Sunday - Yerevan - 297 day of immigration

Ksusha is in Russia next week. I am alone again. Usually it's hard for me. I like trying to be independent, but I am not ready for being alone. Maybe in the future I will handle it. But not now. Also I was coding for a whole day. Another important thing I did was the message for obtaining letters of intent. I need to get a couple of them. I really want to immigrate I am really going to do everything possible for it. The next week is extremely important for it. I will start doing something new. I am exciting about it. I believe in humanity. At the same time I still believe in people. It's important pillar of my life. It's the basis so to speak. I will go to sleep now. I need to have a rest and start work.

# 24 July - Monday - Yerevan - 298 day of immigration

It was a hard day. I was coding for a whole day. Also I need to remake all my life strategy. It's very hard. Tomorrow will be the same shit. I don't like to be alone. You know that because I always write about it. I miss Ksusha. This week is extremely hard and it's very painful. So many ways exists to different directions. I also complained about it before. However I still swimming deep in theory ocean. I try to lear every day. I had an interview today. It was for about one hour. It was a conversation about coding theory where I wasn't so good. I will be really surprised if the give me an offer. I think it's impossible. At the same time I recieved another code challenge that I need to finish soon. I have no idea where to find time for it. I need to wake up early morning tomorrow and immediately start working. It's hard time.

# 25 July - Tuesday - Yerevan - 299 day of immigration

Today I had tons of meetings. We were discussing the new approach for patient portal in DR SMILE. It was long call. I also had one interview today. It was nice but I think absolutely useless. Tomorrow I need to work really hard to finish all other tasks. I had a lot of them. I will go sleep soon because of it. I have tight schedule tomorrow. I also me Alexander today. He is my ex-teammate from Retec company. I used to work for them many years ago. We discussed som interesting and exiting topics. He also had to leave Russia. Moreover he had huge problems in the contry before. He was under mobilization and even got restriction list for leaving country. Fortunately he found a way how to leave this hell. Unfotrunately he was fired from his job and currently he looks for another place. It is really sad because he has family and little daughter. Good thing that I almost got two letters of intent from German companies. Unfortunately these letters are from companies that are not based in Berlin. I intent to be there though. Honestly this talk with Alexander made my mood better. I feel good right now.

# 26 July - Wednesday - Yerevan - 300 day of immigration

This week is absolutely crazy. I am extremely tiered again. I was working for a whole day and it was absolutely crazy and hard. So, yea. This morning the gas inspector came to me. Previous people that lived in the apartments didn't pay for it. Also I got finally stable internet connection. The rest of the day I just had calls. I was coding as well a lot. Now I am ready for sleep. the day was absolutely insane. Maybe I will feel better. Tomorrow I need to try protecting a case that one company provided to me. It will an interview for engineering manager position. I need to figure out how to help people in reducing a bunch of issues. So, tomorrow will be also extremely hard day. Also I had a tech interview today. I don't thing that I passed.

# 27 July - Thursday - Yerevan - 301 day of immigration

I had an amazing interview this morning. I presented a case to them. It was cool again. Tomorrow I also should do a lot. It will be hard. I really need to have a short rest. It's just hard. I really wait for Ksusha because I feel loneliness. You know that I don't like to be like that. Also I had a horrible conversation with Suman. It so hard to loose him. I like to work with him and this is not fair. So, I definitely need to change my approach to 1-1 and other stuff. I moved my attention to completely different things. It was a great experience for me. I need to do some analysis what really happened. I feel the situation as my personal fault. I should be more proactive and protective. It's my fuck up. I lost the second person in the team for the last several years. I don't try to lead it basically. It happened because they stole some responsibilities that I wanted to have and after that I started doing things as a programmer rather a lead. I will do some notes tomorrow.

# 28 July - Friday - Yerevan - 302 day of immigration

Sometimes I feel that this diary became a just list of things that I did. I cannot stop doing this. The life is so stable and strange. I do the same things every day. I think that I need to write other things, but every time I can think only about job. Shitty stuff. Also I did one test task that was not interesting. Also my mood is terrible. I miss Ksusha. She and Nastya gave keys from apartments where I lived in Saint-Petersubrg. I don't have home there anymore. It's really frustrating.s It's really depressing. I could't visit it last time. I miss home. I really cannot go back to the place anymore. Blyat. Shit. I will go to sleep now. I cannot collect myself together now. Life is not so funny.
