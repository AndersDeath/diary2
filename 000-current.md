# 01 June - Samstag - Berlin - 618 Tag der Einwanderung - Hot Sunny

I did a maniqure today and it was enjoyful for me. I will repeat it definitely. Then we were on templhof field and walked a lot. I enjoyed the day. In general I did just nothing and it was nice. This saturday was really nice and calm. I only learned a little bit german. Sometimes it's just cool to do nothing. Neighbours were screaming for a whole evening due to football match. Dortmund plated with Real. And lost.

I liked this Sunday. I did tons of things. For example I prepared a technical task for a freelancer that supposed to fix Mostmag finally. I am tiered of removing virus and I don't have enough time for it. I did my homework and prepared for tomorrow's onboarding in Visable. It's nice. I am happy to change the job. I hope to be good manager and will do it. Additionally I am glad to see nice progress with Holy Theory project. I am about to finish all things regarding builder and very soon it will be ready for new books. It's really cool. Now I will go to have a little bit rest. Oh, I forgot to mention. Very soon I am flying to Paris. Tickets are already bought.

Today was my the first day in Visable company. I experienced a nice onboarding in the morning and recieved a pretty cool laptop for work. I was surprices because I didn't expect so nice thing. It's m3 laptop with tons of memory. In the end of the day I was really tired and barely could think. Because of visiting of the office I had to cancel german lesson. I don't like when something like this happened. It was sad. I also met some of my new colleegs. Yes. Final good buy to xu company. It was intersting buy I will not miss it.
