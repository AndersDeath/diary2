# 01 May - Monday - Barcelona - 214 day of immigration

Today we were in the park that was in Parfumer movie. There is a labyrinth there. It's quite nice place and I was surprised. we also were at plau de la musica which is one of the first modernizm buildings in Barcelona. The rest of the day we spent at home. I also definitely have to proceed with sport and meditation. I also was coding with pleasure today. It's quite rare situation. I also finally finished with Holy Theory metadata adding. It's cool. The documentation for holy theory generator is also finished. It will be a short and simple javascript program which helps to prepare data for eleventy and just simple readme file. I will come back to walking. I went to Barcelona's beach and had a nice time there. Ksusha stayed at home and I was there alone. Anyway it was a pleasure. I was listening to techno and other music.

# 02 May - Tuesday - Barcelona - 215 day of immigration

This day was a good. We didn't walk a lot and I am not so tiered. I can say the same about Ksusha. I had an interview with Happeo guy. It was nice and short. I also did sport and meditation that is amazing because for the last several weeks I didn't have power to do it. I decided now that I have one sacred hour for my body every day. I need to change my body shape. I think that it is a time. I am 35 years old and my body and health will never be better but only worse. So, it's my goal. In general I finished with almost all tasks from my list. Also I started enjoying Barcelona. Initially my impression wasn't so good, but now everything is ok and I can say that my opinion changed in some ways. I want to listen to source video about this city shortly and then decide if I need to record some another part for some reasons.

# 03 May - Wednesday - Barcelona - 216 day of immigration

So, I am sitting in Buenos Migas place which is one of the places where it is possible to eat for affordable price in this city. I tried to rerecord my video about Barcelona this morning but I got only piece of shit. Local streets are extremely noisy and I didn't find a place where I can be in calm env. I also changed a plan for the video. Now it has strong structure that I want to try the next morning. From another side this day was quite calm. The day after tomorrow in the nearest friday we are leaving this city. the first stop will be Rome, that Dortmund. After that we are going to use douchebahn and enter to Berlin. In general this vacation is quite cool because I finally looked at Spain through key whole. In general I got good impressions about this country. MAybe it's because I like Spanish language though. Neverming I got good time. The first week was hard but now I am ok and ready to start doing new great things.

# 04 May - Thursday - Barcelona - 217 day of immigration

Today we finally to CosmoCaixa. It's a museum on science in Barcelona that was founded by loca Caixa bank. I hope I typed this title correctly. It's a cool place awith interactive things and fishes and ancient animals. I wish to had such place when I was a kid. I also finally recorded all video sources. The latest attempt wasn't so good. Tomorrow I'm going to start editing of this stuff. We also was in Hard Rock cafe. Barcelona's version sucks. Yerevan's one is much better. We also started to look for an apartments in Yerevan for summer when I have to go there in order to finish with my teeth. Hopefully I will have the full set if them this summer. At the same time I found a bit time for studying today and worked on nuxtjs understanding. this technology is quite interesting. I don't like vuejs in general but I can say that it's simple for understanding. I forgot to mention that this day is the final full one in this trip to Spain. We are flying to Rome tomorrow evening. After one night and short stay we will go Dortmund. I've never been there and it will quite interesting experience for me.

# 05 May - Friday - Barcelona - 218 - day of immigration

We are flying to Rome today and tomorrow's morning we will be in Dortmund for one night. Unfortunately today is strike in barcelona and our flight will be delayed for one hour. I apparently don't like it but cannot do anything. It's 17:37 o'clock and in several minutes I will have a call with some German company. It'll be a short introduction call. It should be this morning but guy from that company asked me to move time. Unfortunately I have only one convenient slot and it's it. I also had a time for coding today. It's also quite cool. I improved holy-theory generator which makes me happy. I think to move some functionality of it into Kentron library because this thing does very similar stuff. The only difference that Kentron has its own templating system but in holy-theory I decided to use pug.

# 06 May - Saturday - Rome/Fiumicino - 219 - day of immigration

It was one of the hardest flights in my life. In barcelona was a strike and my airplane departures without baggage. we spent the whole night in the airport. Airbnb guy fucked us up and just stopped answering. In beginning our flight was delayed for two hours. Than we set intro the airplane but after landing the capitan said that our baggage was arrived partially. But it was a lie because there wasn't any luggage. Capitan couldn't not to know about it. It was lie. Then I spent a lot of time with papers and airport stuff. Basically all germany visit will be cancelled. Everything goes wrong because of them. I will not visit Dortmund and the same will be for Berlin I suppose. I feel really bad because of it. I have to wait my luggage and don't know how long. I am sue that I will return my goods but all this shit makes me very nervous. Finally I need to stay in a fucking motel near airport. I will think about it.

# 07 May - Sunday - Rome/Fiumicino - 220 - day of immigration

We was in Ikea today and it was beautiful. We tasted some delicious ikea food. I missed it so much. Basically we spent the whole day in that shopping mall. Now we are in the motel. I still have a hope that my luggage will be put to today's flight and delivered to Rome. Otherwise we have to be here more. It's also extremely expensive to be here. The price is about 100 euros for night. 10 days and I am bankrupt. It's really nervous situations. I was out of comfort so much last year when I had to leave Russia. In this kind of moment I feel really how I miss my apartments in Murino. I miss mother, granny, aunt, Nastya and others. It's painful. I really want Russian authorities to be changed. I really want to go back home but I still remember why I left country. I want to be alive much more. I want to have a rest from moving from place to place. I wanted to have a nice vacation but as a result I got stressed situation. I didn't have a rest actually. At the end I again try to fix issues.

# 08 May - Monday - Fiumicino/Ostia - 221 - day of immigration

we didn't get oug luggage. Fucking wizzair and barcelona didn't send it to Rome. We moved to an apartments. This place is quite cozy. We decided that if tomorrow our baggage will not be sent We will go to Barcelona and try to get in on place. Ksusha is extremely devastated. I support her as I can. I will not go to Berlin. It's too expensive. I hate it. In general I am extremely tiered of this situation. I really don't want going to fucking Barcelona. I want to just be relaxed a bit. Fuck them all.

# 09 May - Tuesday - Ostia - 222 day of immigration

We finally got our luggage. It happened in the first part of the day. So, we lost about 1000 euros because of this strike and Wizzair. Tomorrow we are going to Antalia. Finally I can be relaxed. The next months will be probably very calm. Anyway I feel much better. My vacation is over by the way but I need to take a day off tomorrow due to the flight. We are flying to destination point with one stop in Istanbul. There are no tickets from Rome that can move us directly. It's not so sad, but it means that tomorrow will be another airport day. Finally we are going to drive to the place by car. We will rent it for one months. It's nice because I really miss driving. I didn't drive a car for more that half a year. At the same time I really like to do this. we also walked in this neighborhood of Ostia. It's a nice place. I really enjoyed this walk because there is a beach and miditerrian sea. Our host is amazing person. He gave keys to us much earlier that we expected yesterday. Today he picked us up in airport which was extremely convenient. I liked it. He is a project manager in Byer company and he's responsible for their logistics systems which is very interesting.

# 10 May - Wednesday - Rome - Istanbul - Antalia - Kas - 223 day of immigration

We finally landed to Turkey. this is amazing. Very soon I will get a car and we will go to apartments. I really dream about nice months. After that we will go to Yerevan back. So, Today's flights were pleasant and calm. We left Rome in the morning and spent 2 hours in Istanbul in transit. Everything went smooth. Now I we have been waiting for our luggage. I also had an interview in airport with one company. Those people lied to me on the first call. I definitely don't want to work for them. At the same time I see mismatch between us. Tomorrows call will be much more important. I hope to do it well. I will wake up earlier in order to do some preparations. I need to talk about vuejs to them which is not my main technology. Anyway I will try to do my best. I also very tiered of everything and will be happy to spent some good time here. I really have this opportunity this time. I don't want when I will go back to Europe after this stress.

# 11 May - Thursday - Kaş - 224 day of immigration

I enjoy staying here. It's amazing and calm place. I was working nicely today and it was amazing. Apartment is amazing and very cozy. We also went to town for having a small dinner. It was quite expensive but not bad. I also had an interesting interview with Parkos company. I am not sure that I passed it. I also think that I need to dive deeper to looking for vacancies because Ksusha mostly working on it and I see that she is very tiered of it. She is on the edge. I also got good review during PCDR process. It's good and now I am much more confident. I also need to work more on presentation on myself. So, I still fighting for my future. I don't want to stop doing things. By the way I also need to start working on video. I will start working on it tomorrow.

# 12 May - Friday - Kaş - 225 day of immigration

This day was full of meetings. I talked a lot about different things to many people. It was quite nice and cool. I relaxed finally. Last week was really hard and I felt really bad. Now everything is much better. I was writing code and did a lot of interesting things today. It was a pleasure to dive back into work. I think that only activities help me not to go crazy. I still feel empty inside due to the war and the fact that I cannot go back home. I really miss my place. I think only now I understood a value of having home. I didn't think about it before and I even didn't expect that it might be so hard to live without understanding and feeling of home. I know that one day I will have the my own place. Unfortunately I cannot expect when it might happen. Nevermind.

# 13 May - Saturday - Kaş - 226 day of immigration

Nothing happened yet. It's 11.20 o'clock and we are going to some small palace which is in 40 minutes driving from here. I hope that this travel will be smooth and good. Now I only want to be calm and have a good rest today. I already finished some tasks in the morning and I hope that I will be able to do others as well. I feel nervous again. Maybe because I just don't want to spend the whole day in the car. So, the next lines I will add in the evening.

So, it's 20.26 o'clock. We came back home. We were in two places including patara beach which is amazing. I had a nice day with Ksusha. I don't write a lot about her. Maybe it's time. I am extremely lucky guy because I have such beautiful girl. I love her so much. We've been together for 9 years. For almost 2 years we are in marriage. Again I am lucky guy and I try to do everything to make her happy. this is extremely hard period of our life. In fact we could live in Russia because only me in danger but she decided to go out of the country with me. I know that she also don't want to be there. She told me that she did it for herself. This is true. But she also has choice. I love her.

# 14 May - Sunday - Kaş - 227 day of immigration

Today I had a lot of time for my own personal development and things. I like such days. We are sitting in a cafe in Kash and do deals on our Laptops. I dressed as an old person. I updated readme project finally and it's amazing. I also updated introduction for my new interviews. I want to try express myself better. It's very important thing that I usually lose. Also the weather is amazing and my mood is also good due to it. Honestly I feel better in general. It looks like I relaxed more here that during my European tour. Turkey is nice place for it. By the way it's election day here in Turkey. Even more: it's presidential elections. Erdogan can lose his chair today. It depends on if he's ready to make a bloodbath here. We will know in few days about it.

# 15 May - Monday - Kaş - 228 day of immigration

This day was quite busy. I did release in DR SMILE which is nice. I also released holy-theory project and finally finished with data generator for readme project. I didn't have time for the last one, but I finally found time. I also had an interview with weird company. A woman couldn't explain what the do to me. I'm really disappointed in them. Tomorrow will be also busy day. I hope nothing bad will happen. I received a request to call with Parkos company that is bad sign. Their manager told me that he sent me a test task but he didn't and now someone wants talking to me. this is bad. I think they will just refuse me. I had a great conversation with Oleg yesterday. He still tries to break a window to Portugal. He almost got all documents for asking for visa. I don't know how it will go to him. Additionally the apartment prices in Portugal are extremely high. They are around 3500-4000 eur for months. This is crazy. I get 5500-6000 eur per months and this is good salary but even me cannot afford it. The situation is crazy.

# 16 May - Tuesday - Kaş - 229 day of immigration

This day was quite nice but absolutely confusing. I had tons of meeting and I feel I did nothing. It's not true but still. So I also had a call with Parkos guy. I expected some shitburger but surprisingly the man told me about coding assessment. It looks like I need to dive deeper to nuxtjs during this week. I need to dedicate two hours of my time for this task on weekend. I don't know maybe I will do on Saturday or Sunday. Anyway I's good news and need to postpone some things that were planned for this week due to preparations. The weather here is amazing. It's really tropical summer here even though it's still spring outside. So, In general this day was busy but not so hard.

# 17 May - Wednesday - Kaş - 230 day of immigration

I finally cooked fucking Docker container for nuxtjs today. It wasn't so easy I need to say. Firstly I didn't do this before, secondly there is a lot of shitty information on the internet that is hard to filter. However I did it and I am quite happy. At the same time I did some important tasks for DR SMILE that is good. Because of all good things my mood is also good. It looks like I will have interesting test task and cool project in DR SMILE as well. Surely It's not so obvious but anyway. It looks like I am very close to getting new knowledge. I'm quite tiered of Angular and I don't want to work with technology anymore. In a couple of day I want to setup Stable Diffusion local version to my laptop and make several tests. If all good I will do some pictures that will public somewhere. It will be interesting.

# 18 May - Thursday - Kaş - 231 day of immigration

Today I was working for whole day and it was nice. I am really tiered but satisfied. Tomorrow I will have short interview with a company, but before that I need to focus on DR SMILE tasks. IF I have time I will read more about nuxtjs and to make some preparations to test task that Parkos should send me shortly. Let's see. In general things go well. The weather today is extremely windy. IT's not so nice as a couple of days before. I think to wear better outfit. In general I feel good and this is amazing. I hope to find new job soon despite the fact that I've been looking for it for 4 month.

# 19 May - Friday - Kaş - 232 day of immigration

This day was quite heavy. I'm really tiered and I really want to have a rest. luckily it's friday. We will got to Fethiye tomorrow. We want to visit supermarket and just walk around. It's big town up north from Kash. I like that place as well. It was my first place for relatively long staying here in Turkey. From job perspective I did a lot of things. I don't want to write a lot of words today. I will just go and relax.

# 20 May - Saturday - Kaş - Fethiye - 233 day of immigration

Today we were in Fethie which is nice place. I like this city very much. Ksusha doesn't like this place and this is rare situation when our preferables are different. The car that we rented issued today. In some moment is just stopped working. Fortunately I asked help to some locals and they did it. They called to renting company and they just asked to reboot cars brain. I am happy of it. I also did some programming that is amazing. I need to do some test for Parkos. I hope I will do it well but let see. I don't know what to expect. I did some preparations and them should help. At the same time I am quite tiered of today. I got some wine and the hadeacke is suffered me in the morning. So, I don't drink alcohol usually due to it. I consider this as addiction that should be defeated in human society. So, Now I will go to sleep.

# 21 May - Sunday - Kaş - 234 day of immigration

Today I did a test task for Parkos. It was disgusting. I don't think that I will get this job. It looks like I fell the test. I am not ready for vuejs and nuxtjs as well. I feel how I drown into depression again. I am so tiered. I felt so good since we left EU. I still think about how little time I have for founding a new job. I feel so bad because of it. My mood changes constantly. At the same time I didn't have a rest enough this weekend. I don't feel power. Sometimes I feel so useless. Usually I am ok but today and especially in Friday I'm absolutely ruined. I hope that I am just tiered and tomorrow I will be well. I still fight with myself

# 22 May - Monday - Kaş - 235 day of immigration

I finally tested stable diffusion today. The result is amazing. I didn't expect so easy process. I like it. Probably I will start my own blog somewhere about picture generation. Maybe I event start using medium blog for it. I think It might be considered as generative art. I also was working a lot on microfrontend setup, I will finish with this task tomorrow. I also was working in Readme project because I finished with nuxtjs pain and it's not necessary to feel pain of it. I also release holy-theory which is amazing. I didn't have a lot of time for working in it last week. I hope to have nice week. Happy monday mother fuckers

# 23 May - Tuesday - Kaş - 236 day of immigration

Today I feel good. I hate this mood carousel. It's annoying when you feel good one day and terrible on the next one. I try not to moan, but cannot stop. I had an interview with one company today and I don't know what to expect from them. It looks like they want to have a person onsite that is already in Berlin. Unfortunately I'm not there. I also did yoga and some stetching. I want to add this things to my life on daily basis. Let's look if I can do it tomorrow though. From other side the day was nice, a lot of interesting tasks + ai stuff + nice food and weather.

# 24 May - Tuesday - Kaş - 237 day of immigration

I had a nice call with Cobe company that pitched some solution for DR SMILE. It was my first such experience. I'm happy to see it. Also I did some cool stuff during the day. it related to programming mostly. Yesterday I realized that it will be nice to share more personal thoughts here. This diary became some kind of report but I didn't start it for this purposes. I wanted to share more personal things here. So, Today I rearranged my sport approach. I really want to prepare my body to some challanges. I still think about getting sailing license. But at the same time I understand that I don't ready physically for it. I think if I start doing it now I will be ready for this challenge in the future. I must get this license just after settling somewhere down. It looks like this year I will live in Armenia. It's impossible to immigrate to some place earlier. It's sad but it's reality that I need to accept. We also watch Friends series now. I really didn't expect that this show would be so cool. It helps me a lot with relaxation and I'm really happy. I want to buy Mattew Perry book and find some more stuff about this. But it general these days are cool.

# 25 May - Thursday - Kaş - 238 day of immigration

This day was good but I feel how I tiered. So, In general nothing happened interesting today. I was coding a lot, tried to finish all my tasks and some extra. My mood is good I cannot complain about it. I still think a lot about my future and what I can do with all this situation that happens around. In general I don't have any new ideas. I still think about immigration and settling somewhere outside of cursed Russia. The sillies thing that I can to is come back. It's the worst thing. But I also reasonable man and understand that with some conditions I will need to do it. Currently I think only about immigration, but... Nobody knows.

# 26 May - Friday - Kaş - 239 day of immigration

Today I did a lot of things but mostly I played with ai tools. Andrey Odintsov advised me deliberate model which is different. It generates amazing pictures without any difficulties. It's cool. I also have to start editing of the video tomorrow. I avoid it as I can. The latest trip was so hard that I don't want to come back to it. I feel much better after starting of stretching exercises. Parkos rejected me that is bad news but not so. I also try to concentrate my effort to positive direction. I recalled about stoic philosophy and I try to keep it.

# 27 May - Saturday - Kaş - 240 day of immigration

Today I had a really nice weekend day. We were at nice ruined hotel on peninsula in Kash. I liked to walk there and tool a lot of nice photos. Then we trie to find a beach that is in so hard to reach place that we decided no to try doing it. THe we drove to Kalkan city and walked there. In general this day was really nice. We also finished watching the 6th season of Friends. I didn't think about bad things and this is nice. I need to make a dishes and then I can go sleep. It's exactly what I will do in 10 seconds.

# 28 May - Sunday - Kaş - 241 day of immigration

I had a horrible night last night. There was a thunderstorm, and the noise was extreme. To make matters worse, mosquitoes bit me throughout the entire night. Despite this, the day turned out to be nice. Unfortunately, I'm tired due to the bad night, but never mind. On a positive note, I finally made progress on the holy theory. I'm glad I found time for it. Today, in general, I'm trying to feel normal, especially in terms of my mood. It's really hard to keep my mind in a normal state. Therefore, I'm going to do yoga in 5 minutes; I think it will greatly help my mood. After that, I will call my mother and start watching the 7th season of Friends.

# 29 May - Monday - Kaş - 242 day of immigration

I programmed the whole day, tackling the main issue of running an Angular microfrontend with ngrx itself. It's proven to be quite challenging, and I haven't resolved this problem yet. Later on, I spent some time with ChatGPT and discovered that it's working well now. That's really nice because I can start using it on a daily basis. In combination with stable diffusion, I can generate interesting content for my blog. The chat feature can greatly assist me in editing my texts. I plan to write more articles for my Medium blog soon and having good tools to help me will be essential. I edited previous day and text that is before this sentence in chatgpt. It think use see the difference. I amazed really. Tomorrow I will work a lot on different complex features. I feel like I'm already tiered =). 

# 30 May - Tuesday - Kaş - 243 day of immigration

I proceeded using chatgpt today and it helped me a lot in preparing to interview and materials to holy theory. I like it. At the same time I still need to do some writings today. From another side I sill feel good that is cool. We do start applying positions for senior engineers that might me another way to immigrate. At the same time we decided to rent an apartments in Yerevan for one year. I'm tiered of moving from place to place. Apparently I cannot find job fast. It's hard. Neverthenless I try to do my best for my future. I started diving into AI stuff and hopefully it will become my main instrument for holy theory and stuff. I really expect evolution of my productivity. However I will see.

# 31 May - Wednesday - Kaş - 244 day of immigration

I thought a lot today about the fact that only we can understand us well. I mean that nobody can understand real motivation and stuff that happens inside in our minds. I would be curious to know what Ksusha things about herself. Surely she can tell me, but I don't think that I can undersand the real picture. the same rule works to me. Anyway I had an interesting interview for engineering position in one of the Berlins startups.
