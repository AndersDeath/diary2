# 01 November - Wednesday - Yerevan - 398 day of immigration

Today I was working on entities for my nx setup. It was interesting and nice. I'm going to finish working on it. BRsided that I was learning German and doing other things. I pissed off of dR SMILE. These morons didn't send money to me again. It makes me really angry. I really want to finish working for them as soon as possible. I pissed off. Also I found how to reach out railway station in Dortmund. It will be easier than I expect because this place has shuttle bus from airport to railway station. It's really nice and not so expensive. Just 10 euros and I am there. In general my vacation goes smooth. I have time to work on many things I spend this time smart. Also me and Ksusha were in cafe today. We got lunch and worked from that place. In couple of minutes we will go to the cinema. Yep, Vacation goes well. I like it.

# 02 November - Thursday - Yerevan - 399 day of immigration

I feel very angry for an unknown reasons. It's been happening since yesterday. It's really simple for me to go out of temper. I don't like it but cannot do anything with it. It's just needed to be mentioned. Also we were in the cinema yesterday in the evening. we watched Killers of the Flower Moon. It's a movie about white americans that were ready for everything
