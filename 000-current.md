# 01 February - Wednesday - Yerevan - 125 day of immigration

Today I recorded a video. When I have time I will edit it and publish. It will be another episode of Immigration Diary. I met a lawyer that will help me with documents. I trained computer science. I don't remember maybe I mentioned it before, I decided to switch my focus to engineering things. I also had a uber call yesterday. Staff engineering position is not so interesting for me, but I will try to pass at least one interview. I am not sure that I will handle it, but who knows. Tomorrow I will probably go to doctor in order to get a certificate of health for permanent residency card. I hope it will be ok. However I need to groom my schedule and understand if I really can go there tomorrow. I will check it shortly. 

# 02 February - Thursday - Yerevan - 126 day of immigration

Today I finished with the first test from Booking. I hope that I did well and everything is good.
