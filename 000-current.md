# 01 January - Sunday - Tbilisi - 94 day of immigration

2023 has been started. I don't like to use this nice numbers for tarting doing something, but I think that 2023 is a good year for starting a new life. Surely It's not the first time when I start a new life, but being and living is not something sustainable, it's constatly changing thing. I already have a plan for those changes. Firts of all mind and body should be main things for me. I'm not in good condition really. I need to focus. I need to change this bad approach. 2022 was a year of mind growing. 2023 should be not only about studying, but also about physical perfection. I cannot be super healthy bodybuilder kind man, but at least I need to fix some health problems like my small belly having and just small musles. It's a good goal, that I need to achive.

Today I moved another several repositories from bitbucket to github. We walked a bit around and found that prices are extrimely expensive here. It's something abnormal. It's out of normal. Nevermind. Tomorrow I'm going to try record a video in English. I hope this will be ok and I will publish it.But at least I will record a video in Russian. I will do it tomorrow mornig while Ksusha is on lesson with her designer tutor. I also use some wine today. It's extrimely rare thing, but I did it. Wow, One important thing - I send my cv to several companies. The seeking job has been started. I'm happy. It's really time.

I've recrded sources for the next video. Probably today I will finish it and publish on youtube. I like this practice because it's more interesting that recording audio pppodcast. It looks like era of pppodcasts has been finished. Also Ksusha has sport today, during this moment I am going to record english video. It will be my first effort to record normal video using foreign language. I finally finished with Rhetoric of Story and got simple certificate. It's funny. So, I finished with almost full list of my deals that I needed to finish. That's good. I feel much better when I can finish something important and interesting. However I need to do much more for finishing all things. From tomorrow I will start recalling basic algorythms. I already started doing it on coursera, but I really don't remember anything. I think I need to reshape the information and memorize it this way.

# 04 January - Wednesday - Tbilisi - 97 day of immigration

Today I was working for the most part of the day. Very soon I will go for a walk, but now I want to write down some thoughts. First of all I finally continued learning process and this is amaizing. I studied English today and some product thinking stuff. Also I registered in Mastadon which is a web3 twitter analogue. I still doesn't know how it exactly works but it's interesting. Significant part of the day was in fight with final cut pro as result Iremoved this shit and downloaded and installed adobe premiere. Tomorrow I will try to do something using this tool. I waste a lot of time and didn't record a video in English which is shame and I dind't look for vacancies. I need to find time for fixing it. Also I need to mention that service in Georgia is still aweful. Today Glovo brought someone's else order. It is a shame because every day something goes wrong with local delivieres. It was the last time when I tried it. I don't want to use it anymore. Food delivieres in Yerevan work significantly better. Also I need to mention that prices here are incredible hight. Abnormally hight I would say.

# 05 January - Wednesday - Thursday - 98 day of immigration

I red a lot of vacancies today and I would say that I'm not so good. I need to change focus. I need to record videos faster and constantly. also it looks like if I want to be relocated to US I probably need to try looking for team lead position. Surely it depends on salary, but anyway. I studied a lot today work on rhetoric and algorithms. Also we went to Georgia expo. It's a bunch of buldings that were buit in USSR and now it reshaped to restaraunts and buisinesses.
