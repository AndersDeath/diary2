# 01 June - Thursday - Kaş - 245 day of immigration

Someone found my github with tons of commits and deicide that I don't do job and just push something to repositories. It's something new in my career. I considered it as a risk when I started doing this project. I mean holy theory project. I don't care what others think about it. I'm completely tiered of this stuff and I cannot carry it anymore. Maybe I think a lot more about it that I should. Anyway I need to fix this situation somehow. I think I need to share what I do to others. I will start from Fedor tomorrow and then maybe share it with Olga. After that I want ti make a call with my team and share this to them. Let's see what will happen. I need to show myself as a strong person that is absolutely sure in his believes. So, I am such person. I think I will fix the problem this way. I hope so.

# 02 June - Friday - Kaş - 246 day of immigration

I talked to Fedor today. He is absolutely ok with things that I do. On Monday I will talk to Olga about my activities and try to resolve the situation. It's really hard to do anything when you have doubts. However I had a nice call with one startup today which has cool conception and I want to try myself in the next interview. Surprisingly they support relocation which is amazing. I hope that I will pass an interview with them because the process is quite simple. But let see. It's not so clear now. Besides that this day was nice and did a lot of things. The mood wasn't so good but I am cool. Tomorrow is holiday and I am happy about that. It will help me to refresh.

# 03 June - Saturday - Kaş - 247 day of immigration

Today I tried to record pppodcast. For some reasons the sound recorded poor and I should to redo it without external mic. At the same time it's the last saturday in this trip to Turkey. We were on beautiful beach. The weather is quite windy today and we didn't swim. Actually we didn't swim at all due to the weather. It's not so good as last year. However I spent great time on it. I was thinking a lot about programming again. I do pretty well in this area for the last time. I'm happy about it. At the same time my condition and mood became much better. Step by step I adopt to new lifestyle that I have to have. I still worry about my ability to pass technical interviews. I will have the nearest one in the wednesday. It will be some kind of crash test for me. I ruined the latest test that I got from Parkos. It's because I thought that I am able to do something in vuejs. In fact I wasn't and just spent 2.30 hour without good result. Bad result is also nice but still. So, now I will go to have a dinner. I am quite hungry today. I spent a couple hours driving and it tiered me. So, I will go. See you tomorrow people.

# 04 June - Sunday - Kaş - 248 day of immigration

This day was nice. We had a nice walk in the town and on peninsula. The weather was extremely hot. All people went to beach and it was impossible to fide a place for freshing up. At the same time I did nothing and just had a rest. On Tuesday night I will be already in Yerevan. I want to come back to the city. We decided to rent an apartments for a long time. I'm happy that we did it. Actually apartments in Yerevan became much chipper that I expected. It's possible to rent an apartment in the city center for reasonable price. Immigration wave stopped. The only thing that I don't like in Yerevan is absence of the sea. It's sad really. I hope that everything will be ok and we leave car successfully and flight will be smooth. Last time I lost so much nerves that I don't want to repeat it again. Another fun fact is that Ksusha started using chatgpt and she likes it. It's nice and something new. I hope that it'll help her a lot. All these AI stuff is very interesting. I will dive into it more and more.

# 05 June - Monday - Kaş - 249 day of immigration

Today I had a nice talk to Olga about the situation with Holy Theory. I will do the next talk with my team tomorrow. I gonna share the information about it and try to convince them that this project is absolutely side. At the same time today the last full day in Kash for us. WE are going to Yerevan tomorrow. We will be there in the middle of the night. I'm happy to come back to Yerevan. We are going to rent an apartments for long term. I want to collect some money until the autumn starts. This savings will be nice in case of relocation. Comstruct fucked me. The CTO guy convinced me that the wanted to send an interview invitation, but he lied. I sent an email to him and his rejected me. Such a bastard. So, anyway I will have an technical interview in wednesday. I'll do in from Yerevan's apartments. I hope an internet connection will be find, but we'll see. 

# 06 June - Tuesday - Kaş - Antalia - 250 day of immigration

So, I am sitting in Antalia airport now. We arrived and check out the car successfully. I got my 200 euros back. It's so cool people. I so stressed last time and it's just hard for me to handle all problems. However I'm doing well I suppose. I mentioned in one the previous diary notes that we decided to rent an apartments for ling term. I personally didn't want to tie myself to Yerevan but I will. I really want to have something like normal life. I hope everything will be good and I will find a way how to immigrate to some another country. I event don't thing about EU as a priority. I saw some bullshit last time. At the same time It's very expensive place. I feel pain when think about it. Nevermind. This night I will be in Yerevan. It's cool because I will live in the city center for a month. If I find some cool apartments in the city center I can even proceed living there. It's very attractive stuff. Yerevan's center is amazing. I liver in the Kentron district for a wile and was impressed. There is everything that I need for normal living. It's really nice. Another cool district is arabkir. I think that it will be nice to live there as well.

# 07 June - Wednesday - Yerevan - 251 day of immigration

I'm here again. The apartment is nice. I live exactly in the city center. I did some x-ray puctures this morning. I'm ready for surgery that'll happen on Friday. It'll be hard, but I really want my teeth back. I also had a technical interview with some guy. I hope to get some feedback soon. Maybe we will proceed working with him, maybe not. I have no idea. It will be understandable later. I'm so tiered today. The flight wasn't in the middle of the night, but still. Fun thing is that only few people were in the airplane. It was my first time to travel in almost empty plane. It's interesting by the way. Tomorrow the day will be easier. I resolved some crusial things and now just can wait for the surgery. Ksusha started applying for senior developer position and I have a big bunch of interviews. This is nice. Maybe I will find a job as a developer. We will see. I don't know.

# 08 June - Thursday - Yerevan - 252 day of immigration

So, I was working for whole day as usual. I wrote code and did some other important things. In the evening we went for a short walk and just got some "fresh" air. Actually it's hard to find good air here. Yerevan has some ecological problems and apparently they don't have money for fixing them. Another important thing that tomorrow I will go to have surgery. Finally. After tomorrow's operation I will be ready for making prosthetics. I'm really happy about that. I will be nice and beauty. However the main thing will be recovering of chewing function. It's really hard for me now to eat some poducts. My teeth aren't ready for it. The only one thing is here that I don't want to experience. Obviously it's pain. I bought some pills that will help me. The previous pain syndrome was so rough that I barely handled it. It was crazy. So, good luck to me tomorrow.

# 09 June - Friday - Yerevan - 253 day of immigration

Today I got surgery and 6 (six) gum formers. Everything is nice now but I feel bad. I have no power. However I did all things from my todolist. I cancelled sport and some other things. I was lying in the bad for the half of day. This is a main point for this day. Tommorow we will go for a walk and to do some other cool stuff. I really want this weekend. The monday is also day off. It will be day of Russia or something like this. Actually I don't have a lot of updated today. Maybe only that I also got an appointment in dentist clinic in 10 days. We will start doing my new teeth. I suppose to have new stiff in 2 or 3 weeks.

# 10 June - Saturday - Yerevan - 254 day of immigration

I watched new spider man animated movie today. The plot is super stupid but animation is amazing. we also walked around the city center today. It was nice and cool. The weather was quite rainy today. It wasn't a problem but still. Despite the rain the temperature outside is high. Yerevan is hot place in summer. I feel a bit better today. Unfortunately I have annoying pain. I think I will be ik in one week. I can't wait for my new teeth. I've going to this for very long time. It's three years process. I wanted to finish it in Russia. The war changed everything. I hope that I will stop saying it one day. It's so weird  that we came back to yerevan two days ago but I feel like i didn't go from the country. It's strange that this city become so important for me. Armenia is nice country. I like this place. I cannot be an Armenia unfortunately. Maybe in some day I will find my place. I don't know. Will see.

# 11 June - Sunday - Yerevan - 255 day of immigration

This sunday is amazing. I did a lot of things I red a book, learned Spanish, wrote articles. Nice day is general. Ksusha recorded her the first blog video which is nice. I think she has everything for doing great videos without any problems. She can speak well. She looks great. She is smart. I really love her. Tomorrow in russia day which brings us another holiday. I will have another 3 introduction interviews with some companies. It will be nice I suppose. The chance to proceed dealing with them is pretty small. You know that this interview period is hard. It's really difficult to have another interview step after the first introduction. The situation is not easy. However I will proceed doing it even though I am sick of it.

# 12 June - Monday - Yerevan - 256 day of immigration

Today is dayoff. I was working on my things for a whole day. It was nice. I finished russian version of article about Holy Theory. This is amazing because I need to publish much more texts on my blog. I think that I finally got in what role I feel better. At the same time I feel much better here in Yerevan. It feels like home. Maybe I even finally start recoding some stuff in English. I don't know. It really depends on my mood. i still feel not so confident in English but I speak using the language every day. Luckily this became my second language. I learn spanish now. Maybe in several years I will be good in it as well. I don't know. Without daily practice it will be hard to achieve. Will see.

# 13 June - Tuesday - Yerevan - 257 day of immigration

Today I visited barbershop which is amazing. My gum still pains. I hope that this shit will be better at the end of the week. In general week started well because I had 4 day offs in a raw. Unfortunately I have to start the new week. Tomorrow's evening I will have several calls with some companies. what will be the result is hard to predict. I really don't know what to do with it. However I adopted to this kind of lifestyle. I prepare to calls everyday. I talk to a lot of people. Maybe or probably I will have some positive impact. I really want to immigrate to some other county but It's really hard. Maybe I will find a way how to do it. every day I think about it. Samurai doesn't have a goal he has only a path. I try to be aligned with this rule. But I feel how time leaks to some place away from me. It's tough. Also I started reading Matthew Perry book. It's quite easy read and it's cool because I am really interested in his biography. He was a cool actor and his Fried's character was amazing. I know what I say because I watch this series every day. It's really cool. Maybe I will also get some new expressions and words from the book. Usually it works for me.

# 14 June - Wednesday - Yerevan - 258 day of immigration

Today I had another interview with Doctoflix. I went nice. The rest of the day I was programming and making some usual things. Todoist is amazing tool that helps we on daily basis and it's amazing. my gum pains. It's awful. In general I so calm now. I don't know why but I feel better. I still miss home but it's not so painful. maybe if I go to Russia I will feel bad. But I don't have such plans. Maybe in one of two years I will go to Russia. It's so unclear. I forgot to say I had another interivew with huge company for backend position. It will be unusual code assessment I suppose. I will try to do my best but I don't thing that It will be ok. I just want to try and made notes about BE interview questions.


# 15 June - THursday - Yerevan - 259 day of immigration

The situation is that I have much more interivews for engineering positions that for managerial. It's not a surprise but still. I had one interivew today and scheduled a couple more for the next week. It's crazy contrast to management positions. I also was programming for whole day. At the same time I felt a huge pain in my gum for whole day. One specific gel helped me a lot and I don't feel pain now.
