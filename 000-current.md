# 01 April - Montag - Berlin - 559 Tag der Einwanderung - Cold Sunny

I hate day of fool. It's always a piece of shit. However nobody pranked me and I am happy about it. At the same time I did a lot of cool things during the day. I learned some stuff and released another version of Holy Theory. On bad thing happened to me. It looks like my haemorrhoids came back to me. I need to have some relief but I don't know how. The situation is dangerous again.

The same weather like yesterday. I feel worse today. We even got a couple of new termins to doctors. I hope to visit them on the next week. I hope to see them really. It looks like I am very close to surgery again. WIll see. I try to get some specific pills that can help me. I need to be on diet now that is sad but important to me. Besides that I did a lot of good things again. I was coding and did some investigation things. To be honest my illness pushed my mood down again. It's painful really. At the same time I still have an illusion that medications will help me.

The day was nice. Nothing fency happened. I still don't feel good. However I did a lot of good things and it's really cool. The day after tomorrow I will go to a doctor and get something him. I hope that my insurance will cover the visit. I really hope. I don't have money for this now. I think everything will be ok.
