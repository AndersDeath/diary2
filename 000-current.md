# 01 February - Wednesday - Yerevan - 125 day of immigration

Today I recorded a video. When I have time I will edit it and publish. It will be another episode of Immigration Diary. I met a lawyer that will help me with documents. I trained computer science. I don't remember maybe I mentioned it before, I decided to switch my focus to engineering things. I also had a uber call yesterday. Staff engineering position is not so interesting for me, but I will try to pass at least one interview. I am not sure that I will handle it, but who knows. Tomorrow I will probably go to doctor in order to get a certificate of health for permanent residency card. I hope it will be ok. However I need to groom my schedule and understand if I really can go there tomorrow. I will check it shortly. 

# 02 February - Thursday - Yerevan - 126 day of immigration

Today I finished with the first test from Booking. I hope that I did well and everything is good. Also the new backend developer started working with us, which is amazing thing. I did several exercises. I've been preparing myself for potential layoffs. It will be very sad if happens. At the same time I do everything for compensation of all this things. Tomorrow I am going to policlinic in order to get health certificate. It's necessary for getting residency permit. At the same time I am tiered of everything. I know that my diaries sometimes sound like moans, but It is as it is. It's hard time. The mood it not good despite the fact that I had the test and will have another interviews with Uber very soon. I feel on the edge. It's fake, I know, but I cannot be calm. You can find in my previous notes that I sometimes can be in good mood. Unfortunately it's not about this year. Everything goes very strange in shady direction.

# 03 February - Friday - Yerevan - 127 day of immigration

Today I got a health certificate in the hospital. It's necessary for getting residency. Basically this process ate the whole day. However I did something and improved some things in my projects. Ksusha went to the manicure master and I am alone here. She also bought tickets to Russian. She's going to Saint-P and Rzhev in March probably. I really want to go back home. I really want to live in normal country. Fucking Putin has stolen my home. Don't want to write anything else. The mood is awful.

# 04 February - Saturday - Yerevan - 128 day of immigration

Today I have a full day off. This is amazing. I decided that having at lest one day off is amazing idea. Usually I cannot do it because my mind isn't free and light. I always have some kind of weight on my shoulders which makes me a not so nice person in some points. Today we are going to the cinema. It will be Big Lebovski in English. I really like that movie and will be happy to watch it again. Every day I learn computer science and it's interesting for me. It's much better that I thought.  Moreover because of starting writing holy theory I have to dive into the topic. Maybe in the future I really finish the book and because a bit famous. It's still a shame for me to dream about fame, but I cannot refuse it. I want it. Partially I decided to record videos because of it. It's really interesting thing. I want to have good acquaintances that can help me in achieving my goal. It's enough for today. See you people.
