# 01 August - Tuesday - Yerevan - 206 day of immigration

So, Today I had lot of call about everything. DR SMILE hired a freelancer that should help me with implementation of the new patient portals. THis is a KPI for my team. I also a call with some potential employer. It's General Electric. I don't expect anything from them. The situation is that I still work on my portfolio. I do it really hard. I need to finish 3 project in 3 weeks
