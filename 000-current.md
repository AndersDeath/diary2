# 01 May - Monday - Barcelona - 214 day of immigration

Today we were in the park that was in Parfumer movie. There is a labyrinth there. It's quite nice place and I was surprised. we also were at plau de la musica which is one of the first modernizm buildings in Barcelona. The rest of the day we spent at home. I also definitely have to proceed with sport and meditation. I also was coding with pleasure today. It's quite rare situation. I also finally finished with Holy Theory metadata adding. It's cool. The documentation for holy theory generator is also finished. It will be a short and simple javascript program which helps to prepare data for eleventy and just simple readme file. I will come back to walking. I went to Barcelona's beach and had a nice time there. Ksusha stayed at home and I was there alone. Anyway it was a pleasure. I was listening to techno and other music.

# 02 May - Tuesday - Barcelona - 215 day of immigration

This day was a good. We didn't walk a lot and I am not so tiered. I can say the same about Ksusha. I had an interview with Happeo guy. It was nice and short. I also did sport and meditation that is amazing because for the last several weeks I didn't have power to do it. I decided now that I have one sacred hour for my body every day. I need to change my body shape. I think that it is a time. I am 35 years old and my body and health will never be better but only worse. So, it's my goal. In general I finished with almost all tasks from my list. Also I started enjoying Barcelona.  Initially my impression wasn't so good, but now everything is ok and I can say that my opinion changed in some ways. I want to listen to source video about this city shortly and then decide if I need to record some another part for some reasons.

# 03 May - Wednesday - Barcelona - 216 day of immigration

So, I am sitting in Buenos Migas place which is one of the places where it is possible to eat for affordable price in this city. I tried to rerecord my video about Barcelona this morning but I got only piece of shit. Local streets are extremely noisy and I didn't find a place where I can be in calm env. I also changed a plan for the video. Now it has strong structure that I want to try the next morning. From another side this day was quite calm. The day after tomorrow in the nearest friday we are leaving this city. the first stop will be Rome, that Dortmund. After that we are going to use douchebahn and enter to Berlin. In general this vacation is quite cool because I finally looked at Spain through key whole. In general I got good impressions about this country. MAybe it's because I like Spanish language though. Neverming I got good time. The first week was hard but now I am ok and ready to start doing new great things.

# 04 May - Thursday - Barcelona - 217 day of immigration

Today we finally to CosmoCaixa. It's a museum on science in Barcelona that was founded by loca Caixa bank. I hope I typed this title correctly. It's a cool place awith interactive things and fishes and ancient animals. I wish to had such place when I was a kid. I also finally recorded all video sources. The latest attempt wasn't so good. Tomorrow I'm going to start editing of this stuff. We also was in Hard Rock cafe. Barcelona's version sucks. Yerevan's one is much better. We also started to look for an apartments in Yerevan for summer when I have to go there in order to finish with my teeth. Hopefully I will have the full set if them this summer. At the same time I found a bit time for studying today and worked on nuxtjs understanding. this technology is quite interesting. I don't like vuejs in general but I can say that it's simple for understanding. I forgot to mention that this day is the final full one in this trip to Spain. We are flying to Rome tomorrow evening. After one night and short stay we will go Dortmund. I've never been there and it will quite interesting experience for me.

# 05 May - Friday - Barcelona - 218 - day of immigration

We are flying to Rome today and tomorrow's morning we will be in Dortmund for one night. Unfortunately today is strike in barcelona and our flight will be delayed for one hour. I apparently don't like it but cannot do anything. It's 17:37 o'clock and in several minutes I will have a call with some German company. It'll be a short introduction call. It should be this morning but guy from that company asked me to move time. Unfortunately I have only one convenient slot and it's it. I also had a time for coding today. It's also quite cool. I improved holy-theory generator which makes me happy. I think to move some functionality of it into Kentron library because this thing does very similar stuff. The only difference that Kentron has its own templating system but in holy-theory I decided to use pug.

# 06 May - Saturday - Rome/Fiumicino - 219 - day of immigration

It was one of the hardest flights in my life. In barcelona was a strike and my airplane departures without baggage. we spent the whole night in the airport. Airbnb guy fucked us up and just stopped answering. In beginning our flight was delayed for two hours. Than we set intro the airplane but after landing the capitan said that our baggage was arrived partially. But it was a lie because there wasn't any luggage. Capitan couldn't not to know about it. It was lie. Then I spent a lot of time with papers and airport stuff. Basically all germany visit will be cancelled. Everything goes wrong because of them. I will not visit Dortmund and the same will be for Berlin I suppose. I feel really bad because of it. I have to wait my luggage and don't know how long. I am sue that I will return my goods but all this shit makes me very nervous. Finally I need to stay in a fucking motel near airport. I will think about it.

# 07 May - Sunday - Rome/Fiumicino - 220 - day of immigration

We was in Ikea today and it was beautiful. We tasted some delicious ikea food. I missed it so much. Basically we spent the whole day in that shopping mall. Now we are in the motel. I still have a hope that my luggage will be put to today's flight and delivered to Rome. Otherwise we have to be here more. It's also extremely expensive to be here. The price is about 100 euros for night. 10 days and I am bankrupt. It's really nervous situations. I was out of comfort so much last year when I had to leave Russia. In this kind of moment I feel really how I miss my apartments in Murino. I miss mother, granny, aunt, Nastya and others. It's painful. I really want Russian authorities to be changed. I really want to go back home but I still remember why I left country. I want to be alive much more. I want to have a rest from moving from place to place. I wanted to have a nice vacation but as a result I got stressed situation. I didn't have a rest actually. At the end I again try to fix issues.

# 08 May - Monday - Fiumicino/Ostia - 221 - day of immigration

we didn't get oug luggage. Fucking wizzair and barcelona didn't send it to Rome. We moved to an apartments. This place is quite cozy. We decided that if tomorrow our baggage will not be sent We will go to Barcelona and try to get in on place. Ksusha is extremely devastated. I support her as I can. I will not go to Berlin. It's too expensive. I hate it. In general I am extremely tiered of this situation. I really don't want going to fucking Barcelona. I want to just be relaxed a bit. Fuck them all.

# 09 May - Tuesday - Ostia - 222 - day of immigration

We finally got our luggage. It happened in the first part of the day. So, we lost about 1000 euros because of this strike and Wizzair. Tomorrow we are going to Antalia. Finally I can be relaxed. The next months will be probably very calm.
