# 01 February - Wednesday - Yerevan - 125 day of immigration

Today I recorded a video. When I have time I will edit it and publish. It will be another episode of Immigration Diary. I met a lawyer that will help me with documents. I trained computer science. I don't remember maybe I mentioned it before, I decided to switch my focus to engineering things. I also had a uber call yesterday. Staff engineering position is not so interesting for me, but I will try to pass at least one interview. I am not sure that I will handle it, but who knows. Tomorrow I will probably go to doctor in order to get a certificate of health for permanent residency card. I hope it will be ok. However I need to groom my schedule and understand if I really can go there tomorrow. I will check it shortly. 

# 02 February - Thursday - Yerevan - 126 day of immigration

Today I finished with the first test from Booking. I hope that I did well and everything is good. Also the new backend developer started working with us, which is amazing thing. I did several exercises. I've been preparing myself for potential layoffs. It will be very sad if happens. At the same time I do everything for compensation of all this things. Tomorrow I am going to policlinic in order to get health certificate. It's necessary for getting residency permit. At the same time I am tiered of everything. I know that my diaries sometimes sound like moans, but It is as it is. It's hard time. The mood it not good despite the fact that I had the test and will have another interviews with Uber very soon. I feel on the edge. It's fake, I know, but I cannot be calm. You can find in my previous notes that I sometimes can be in good mood. Unfortunately it's not about this year. Everything goes very strange in shady direction.

# 03 February - Friday - Yerevan - 127 day of immigration

Today I got a health certificate in the hospital. It's necessary for getting residency. Basically this process ate the whole day. However I did something and improved some things in my projects. Ksusha went to the manicure master and I am alone here. She also bought tickets to Russian. She's going to Saint-P and Rzhev in March probably. I really want to go back home. I really want to live in normal country. Fucking Putin has stolen my home. Don't want to write anything else. The mood is awful.

# 04 February - Saturday - Yerevan - 128 day of immigration

Today I have a full day off. This is amazing. I decided that having at lest one day off is amazing idea. Usually I cannot do it because my mind isn't free and light. I always have some kind of weight on my shoulders which makes me a not so nice person in some points. Today we are going to the cinema. It will be Big Lebovski in English. I really like that movie and will be happy to watch it again. Every day I learn computer science and it's interesting for me. It's much better that I thought.  Moreover because of starting writing holy theory I have to dive into the topic. Maybe in the future I really finish the book and because a bit famous. It's still a shame for me to dream about fame, but I cannot refuse it. I want it. Partially I decided to record videos because of it. It's really interesting thing. I want to have good acquaintances that can help me in achieving my goal. It's enough for today. See you people.

# 05 February - Sunday - Yerevan - 129 day of immigration

The last day of weekend was also cool. It was quite calm and without anything significant. I bought a new hoody which is nice. ow, Yesterday we were on the big lebowski movie. It was quite nice and interesting. I live this film and was happy yo watch it once again. I finished with editing of youtube video that I want to publish tomorrow. It's the best thing that I did for all period of time. For unknown reasons the rendering was interrupted by error. Something happened with fonts. I don't know what is that thing exactly because I use standard fonts there. I will try handle this shortly. Also I published the first shorts video on youtube. Let's talk a bit about programming. today I was working on resolving matrix algorithms. My brain is not so good and it was really hard to recall all those things about matrix, how to fill it correctly or turn it to 90 degrees to right. All this shit will be in the holy theory. I will publish a new article about it tomorrow.

# 06 February - Monday - Yerevan - 130 day of immigration

I did great thing I met my Lower she will bring my documents to OVIR tomorrow. This is very good. Also I fixed Ksushas boots. The master was cheap and it's good. A sad thing also happened. My beloved Pixel 3xl has a blown battery. At the same time I had cool calls with my team. Today happened another bad thing. it's earthquacke in Turkey that killed many people there. Even Batumi, Cyprus and Turkey - Armenian border felt this thing. I called to my mom. Luckily everything is good with her. I don't have time to make calls often. I feel bad because of it. I did yoga and meditation this morning. That was cool. For whole day I didn't have event 5 minutes for rest. It's 21.18 oclock now. I will go to sleep. Just read a book and lie down in bed.

# 07 February - Tuesday - Yerevan - 131 day of immigration

The lawyer carried my documents to OVIR. So, the timer has been started. In 45 days i will have local documents. this is amazing things because after that I will have more freedom. Also I studied as well as programmed today. I try to be in track in my preparations to the next interview. I signed for hackerrank quick study plan, that will help me to be more prepared to the interview. I don't expect anything, but I am sure that I will be better in computer science. I improved readme project which is not only the first project that I will make in public, but also great practice in reactjs. I learned about this stuff today as well. Very soon I need to recall how to manage state management system with trunks. It's crustal thing in reactjs ecosystem I would say. So, yea, this day was extremely hard, but I satisfied by it. Everything goes by my plan right now. I know that event tomorrow it might be changed, but I decided to be comfort with what I have.

# 08 February - Wednesday - Yerevan - 132 day of immigration

I feel not so good today. This night was so cold and I am under the weather unfortunately. Despite this fact I am still in the middle of preparations to Uber interview. It'll be hard I suppose, but this preparations will be very useful for future looking for a job. I again feel bother of Yerevan. This is a great city, but It's definitely not the place of my dream. I will do everything for living in another place. I know that It will be hard to move myself to US for example. I consider myself as a warrior. My life is some kind of war where I fight with myself and others. So, today I again read a lot of useful things and tried to finish as much as I can.

# 09 February - Thursday - Yerevan - 133 day of immigration

So, Today I got a day off.  I don't feel good. I'm a bit under the weather. I did not so much. I refactored readme project which is is cool. It's another example how I misestimate things. I do it every time. Hoverer it might be a problem with my focus. I don't know exactly how to understand it. But if we talk about other things I made a lot of them.

# 10 February - Friday - Yerevan - 134 day of immigration

Today I had a full day of meeting, which was hard. I presented some features in front of all DR SMiLE. It was awful. I am a bad performer. I still didn't find time for videos in English. I will change it soon. I promise it. It's really hard way for me. Just start to talk English in front of hundreds people is always hard. I cannot fight my anxiety. At the same time I feel better today. I don't feel so powerless. I found some time for holy theory. I touched readme project as well.

# 11 February - Saturday - Yerevan - 135 day of immigration

Saturday is transitionally the off day. We was walking for whole day. It was perfect I believe. I feel much better today. We visited Barev cafe. It's a project of russian immigrants. Food there is cool, the mood is awful. If they don't change decoration of room, nobody goes there. We were in Tumo studio. It's nice art place where were a temporary exhibition of a Armenian art student. I got a lot of nice things in Wilberries. It's also cool. I feel good physically but brain doesn't work. I really need to work more on my English speaking skills. It's so hard for me to start doing it.

# 12 February - Sunday - Yerevan - 136 day immigration

We were in two new places today. The first one is ground zero cafe. It's something like co-working space. The second place is DOC. It's really awful restaurant-bar. It's hard imagine so bad food for such price. Really, SAS food court is much better. I spent a couple hours with algorithms today. It was productive thing. I had a good rest this weekend. I am happy about that. I'll have the first normal interview in two days. I don't remember what company will be it, but it doesn't matter. Monday will be also another release day for holy theory. I hope I will push this project and do something interesting with it.

# 13 February - Monday - Yerevan - 137 day immigration

Today I faced with Inecobank stupidness again. I went there for 6 statements about my bank transactions. So, these people forgot to change my passport number in the system. As a result I took those statements came back home and realized that the number is wrong. I had to go back and ask them to fix it. I paid 3000 for this types of documents that thy fucked up. Sadly I spent to much time on it and almost didn't find time to finish all business today. I was so pissed that I decided to consider meditation missing as a crime. I didn't call my mom and this is my fuck up. I'll do it tomorrow. Another piece of bad news is that Portugal stopped accepting application for D7/Digital Nomad visas in Belgrad. This is extremely bad thing because Oleg is there now and he already paid to someone who should help him.
