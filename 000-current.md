# 01 October - Sunday - Saint-Petersburg - 367 day of immigration

I met Mom and aunt Anya today. I was happy to see them. I met mother in the city center on Nevsky prospect after that I visited Anya on Chkalovskaya. She lives on Kupchinskaya street. It was meeting. I enjoyed it. After that I met ksusha and we went to Sevkabel port. It's a cultural place on Vasilyevskiy ostrov. In general the day was nice. We finished preparation of documents. Tomorrow we will go to the visa center and at 3pm we will sit to Spsan and go to Tver. There we will met Igor and he will drive us to Rzhev. After one day there we are going to Moscow and back to Yerevan. The only concern is how I will cross the border. It's not so clear. I hope that there will be no problems. Will see. Now I am sitting in Nasya's studio and waiting for Ksusha. oh, We also were in Balagan food court. It's a nice place on Chkalovskaya with a lot of nice mini-restaurants. I was there before and I was happy to visit that place again. So, also I need to take a shower and go to sleep.
