# 01 June - Samstag - Berlin - 618 Tag der Einwanderung - Hot Sunny

I did a maniqure today and it was enjoyful for me. I will repeat it definitely. Then we were on templhof field and walked a lot. I enjoyed the day. In general I did just nothing and it was nice. This saturday was really nice and calm. I only learned a little bit german. Sometimes it's just cool to do nothing. Neighbours were screaming for a whole evening due to football match. Dortmund plated with Real. And lost.

I liked this Sunday. I did tons of things. For example I prepared a technical task for a freelancer that supposed to fix Mostmag finally. I am tiered of removing virus and I don't have enough time for it. I did my homework and prepared for tomorrow's onboarding in Visable. It's nice. I am happy to change the job. I hope to be good manager and will do it. Additionally I am glad to see nice progress with Holy Theory project. I am about to finish all things regarding builder and very soon it will be ready for new books. It's really cool. Now I will go to have a little bit rest. Oh, I forgot to mention. Very soon I am flying to Paris. Tickets are already bought.

Today was my the first day in Visable company. I experienced a nice onboarding in the morning and recieved a pretty cool laptop for work. I was surprices because I didn't expect so nice thing. It's m3 laptop with tons of memory. In the end of the day I was really tired and barely could think. Because of visiting of the office I had to cancel german lesson. I don't like when something like this happened. It was sad. I also met some of my new colleegs. Yes. Final good buy to xu company. It was intersting buy I will not miss it.

I have to rearrange my schedule because It's it really hard to do things now. I don't have time. This day was really hard. Tons of onboarding meetings just expoded my mind. I also was in the office today because I needed to be there. I cannot say that it was really enjoyable but still. I needed to be there. In common this comapny has a specific policy that forces people to be in the office twice per week. All other time we can work at home. It's not so good but me as a part of IT department can break the rule. I can be in the office 8 day in a row and then I can fomr home until the end of the month.

I was working from home for a whole day. I started scheduling meeting with my programmers. I have 5 people under me that is really nice for me. I wan't to esablish my skills better and better. So I need to work on it a lot. At the same time I found some minimal time for my own projects. All of the are hevily important for me. In the evening I was in Toastmasters club as a member for the first time. I need to find a time somewhere for dealing with all of this and understand what happened on the webside. The speaker career is important. This skill is essencial.

# 06 June - Donnerstag - Berlin - 623 Tag der Einwanderung - Warm Sunny

Today I had an arguments with Ksusha. It's really rare situation when we conflict. It was hard. I almost did nothing. I could only to concetrate somehow and visit German lesson. The day was horrible. Also I cannot undertand if dr smile sent me money or not. It looks like they fucked me up again. I hate them so much. They are absolutely insane and stupid morons. It's something unbelivable.

# 07 June - Freitag - Berlin - 624 Tag der Einwanderung - Warm Rainy

We are ok now. I believe that huge pressure that we experienced broke us a little bit. Luckily we handled this. Today I worked from home and it was good. I didn't do a lot of things because it's really hard to memorize everything. At the same time I did good progress this week in Visable. I talked to all people that I leed and it's really cool thing. I am happy about it. Funny thing is that this friday makes me really happy because I need to have a little rest. Well deserved rest.
