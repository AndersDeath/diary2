# 01 March - Wednesday - Yerevan - 153 day of immigration

Today I was working for whole day on DR SMILE projects. My local Angular setup has been broken and nothing works. It's absolutely sad thing. It means that tomorrows morning I will be working on resolving of this thing. I was talking to Narayan for whole day. This man is from India and he works for Dr SMILE as front-end engineer. I didn't have tim eto make a lot of commits unfortunately. I added two trainings to Holy Theory. I like this project. tomorrow I will work a lot on docker containerization. Also I am going to work on another things related to system design questions. I've got an access to Notion AI today. This tool is amazing but it has a tiny limit of requests. I spent them all on useless requests, but I had fun. Besides that I had a call wit Olga where we discussed things that we are working on now and difficulties that we have. It's a good thing because It changes bad stuff and made me calmer. by the way It's +16 in Yerevan today. The weather is cool.

# 02 March - Thursday - Yerevan - 154 day of immigration

I was in Podolog office today. I need to treat heel for about two weeks more. I visited Ineco office and they finally moved me to basic tariff which is much better. I have much more convenient conditions now. Besides that I finished three leetcode challenges. I've still been working on readme project. I am going to finish with this version very soon. Right now I added almost all that I wanted to add. Interesting topic will be gathering of information and monitoring. This is for the future. At the same time I feel myself better today. I've started using of mood tracker. I'm worried about possible bi-polar disorder. I cannot understand why my mood can be so different. It's hard. I know that I have ADHD. I never checked it, but I have all evidences of it. Maybe it the future I will go to specialists and they will help me.

# 03 March - Friday - Yerevan - 155 day of immigration

Today I again spent time on learning. I really enjoy it. It also cool that this day is Friday. It's the last Friday in tis apartments by the way. WE are going to leave this place very soon. I feel good today, which is amazing. You know how often it changes. I was writing code today, enjoyed my meal and other things. I practiced meditation today. I like it really helps me. I think that it changes my problem to better conditions. Anywa. The nesxt week will be had. I am going to be on two technical interviews. This weekend is my lastest change to do some preparations. And I will do them.

# 04 March - Saturday - Yerevan - 156 day of immigration

Today I had a classic day off. We were in National Gallery of Armenia. It's a museum in the city center. it's quite old soviet building that was designed as museum. there are huge and nice halls with temporary exhibitions and permanent things. I was surprised because some things were really interesting. At the same time we tasted a pizza in one place which name I don't remember. It wasn't so good. After that we visited Dalma garden mall that is maybe the biggest shopping center in Yerevan. I bought some clothes there. in the evening we just ordered burgers. I was thinking a lot about my future. Sometimes I don't feel power for fight with the life. It's hard to see all this bullshit. Sometimes I really want to be just a programmer. It's simpler and more understandable. When I look around I think that It's to much pressure from outside on me. The war and my career it's hard. My again. I feel those feeling but don't give up.

# 05 March - Sunday - Yerevan - 157 day of immigration

Today we were on movie Капитан Волконогов бежал. It's a Russian filme about NKVD guy who didn't want to kill innocent people and stole a folder with files of executed people and tried to find forgiveness in order to be on Heaven after his death. It was a very hard movie for me. It was made in Saint-Petersburg which is my home city. Hundreds of people were murdered there during 1932-1952. It happened not oly because of the WWII but also due to Stalin's laws. Memorial organization was working for years on revealing fact of outlaw executions. It was a very good activity. So, Now russian government banned this organization and tres to put its member to jail. In general this movie is about daily basis evil. Hard thing by the way. I also made some preparations for next week interviews. I hope it will be ok. I'll try to do best. Another thing is tah we were walking today a bit. I miss for physical activity. Tomorrow I need to do full pack of exercises. It will be fun, I hope.

# 06 March - Monday - Yerevan - 158 day of immigration

Today I had a full day of meetings. I am exhausted. It feels like I lost all energy. Really hard things. There is also some weather changes in Yerevan. At the same time I will have an important interview tomorrow and the day after tomorrow. Tomorrows one will be not so crucial, but I will try to do my best. The next one will be for Booking. I still have a hope to get the job in Booking company. But I don't want to make myself confident in it. I don't do that because I don't want to feel place in case of failure. Another bad thing is that I didn't do sport and meditation today. I so want to sleep that It will be just another painful thing. Now I only want to have a rest. I feel like I didn't have a weekend. The only great thing today is that I made a another release of Holy Theory.

# 07 March - Tuesday - Yerevan - 159 day of immigration

Today I had a call with Catawiki. It was a simple coding interview. It was cool. I am not sure that it is successful, but interesting. Also I had a internal TJ demo. It was interesting and cool as well. I had a kinda conflict with head of engineering, but I enjoyed it. Another cool piece of news is that We got Spain visas for 30 day. It means that we will be flying to Rome and Barcelona! I like it. Tomorrow I will have a call with Booking. I hope it will be good. Let's see, now it's absolutely unclear. This night is also the last on Shararnery 31. It's sad but we have to leave this apartments. It's sad. I would like to eat in SAS food court. Unfortunately it's impossible.  Let's see. At the same time good news about visa increase my mood significantly. It's sad that it's only for 30 days and 3 entries, but It's better that nothing. Next time I hope they will give it for more time. Ok. Now I need to go have a dinner and then clean an apartments. It's the latest day here. 

# 08 March - Wednesday - Yerevan - 160 of immigration

We moved to other apartments today. This place is much bigger I would say. I will have normal place for programming. This is amazing. Unfortunately all kind of privacy ruined because the working table stays in the place where everybody could see the screen. I really hate this kind of set up. At hte same time it's quite sad to be too far from SAS food court. Another bad thing is that Booking postponed the interview again. It's something incredible. If those people cannot organize just a call it means that they are absolutely awful. I ruined my schedule because of them. Hopefully I found some time for coding and preparations. Today I was working on graph search. I need to understand this technic much better. Currently it's not so good. i understand it only on theoretical level. I will improve it significantly. About mood and stamina. I again feel bad. mood is bad, I have no power. I need to meditate more, probably.

# 09 March - Thursday - Yerevan - 161 of immigration

This day was extremely hard. Depression is covering me again. It looks like I really have bi-polar disorder. Maybe it is just a reflection of situation of my job. I still don't have interest in DR SMILE's project. It still looks like a shit. Management is awful. I cannot wait a moment when I join to another company. It's really painful to work for a company that you don't want to work for. I have interview every week know, but all of them are unsuccessful. I feel some invisible barrier that I cannot break out. I still work hard on theoretical things and do everything for successful interviews passing every day. It is still not enough. I know that those every day steps will have some impact ones, but I really want to achieve it faster. This everyday struggles make me sad and unsustainable. One day I feel a lot of power and feel like I can do absolutely everything. Today I feel bad. I think this repetitions are annoying you. I'll stop. Meditation is the only thing that helps me. I try to do it on daily basis. It's extrimely helpful for such unreligious people like me. Nothing else helps.

# 10 March - Friday - Yerevan - 162 day of immigration

This day was better than yesterday. First of all I put myself together and found power to be better. I had a great conversation with Fedor about programming and other stuff. I also cleaned up a bit code in DR SMILE. Catawiki company rejected me. It expected this. The other cool thing is that today is Friday. I'll have some rest and this is amazing. I event found time for working on holy theory project. I still feel amazing about it. From another side it's time to shape project in better view. Eleventy project is still waiting for my time. I hope to find time for it the day after tomorrow. Also it's time to record another episode of emigration diary. I have something to tell people. I am not sure that I can do it on Sunday but I will try. Another thing is that I need to reschedule my schedule. Basically my timeline inflated and doesn't reflect the real life. It's another difficult task. It also needs to be done this weekend.

# 11 March - Saturday - Yerevan - 163 day of immigration

This Saturday is nice. I like it. This apartments is much closer to the city center and it is huge benefit. We went for a walk and it was much better that near the previous place. It's sad that there is no food court. It's the only huge cons here. I improved a bit holy theory project. I like it. Today I surprisingly  feel good. My mood is also much bette today. I think that this day is good. I am going to record another episode of emigrant diary tomorrow. I also will start working on English instagram account. Maybe it will help me with speaking. Another thing I want to increase my confidence level. It will be nice. I really need it now. Oh, by the way I changed my google drive tariff today. Now I have 200 gb.

# 12 March - Sunday - Yerevan - 164 day of immigration

I've been fighting with myself for whole day. Initially I didn't feel well. I was extremely nerveous this morning. I did meditation and some sport. It made my condition better. Then I moved outside and recorded the next episode of emigration diary. It's very cool. The weather today was warm. It's so nice that it can be +18 degrees in the beginning of spring. I was coding a bit today and did some other interesting stuff. We were watching Friends series and I can say that it's very cool thing. I didn't expect it. I used to ignore it because considered it stupid. So I was wrong. However I might be not ready those times. Another bad thing here it that due to an accident internet connection isn't working. I found this piece of news on the internet.

# 13 March - Monday - Yerevan - 165 day of immigration

Today I was working on current tasks. I did a lot of things today. I did sport and meditation and some coding exploring. I had a interview with recharge company. A guy from Nigeria had a conversation with me that was very cool and nice. I think it was the easiest tech conversation for last three years. Let's see what we will have soon. I made a release of Holy Theory that is also good. The weather here is awesome. Yerevan's spring is amazing. After living in Saint-Petersburg this place looks much more attractive. From another side I miss home very much. i dream about time when it will be possible. I like weather here, but I cannot get home feeling, do you know what mean? I really want to sit in my car and drive a circle around neighborhood. Survey I want to record pppodcast in usual and convenient way. Sadly it's impossible for now. Maybe in the future I will obtain this possibility.

# 14 March - Tuesday - Yerevan - 166 day of immigration

I am extremely tiered today. I had a system design interview with Booking.com. I am absolutely not sure that it was successful. I have nothing to compare. It's the fist system design interview in my life. It's very cool. Bad thing is that I cannot predict what will be the final solution on their side. I know that a lot of people want to be relocated to amsterdam. let's see. It will be another one hour interview with Recharge tomorrow. I hope it will be ok. I read on the internet that it's now the best company in Netherlands. It's not a big problem for me, because my goal is to relocate to Europe. I don't want to live in yerevan for whole life. Also, it's no water in the apartments today. I already hate it. It's extremely sad thing.

# 15 March - Wednesday - Yerevan - 167 day of immigration

Today I fixed several issues for DR SMILE. Tomorrow I will do the same. I resolved several leetcode tasks, that were easy and nice. Tomorrow I am going to talk to Recharge company. I don't expect anything from it. It will be just another talk, not more. Due to this event I had to move my podologist to another day. Another significant thing for today is that I was working on coding readme project. I like to do it, because it the thing that moves me forward. at the same time I am extremely tiered.

# 16 March - Thursday - Yerevan - 168 day of immigration

I had an interview with Recharge. It was a usual algorithmic talk. This is nice. I did some mistakes and in some moment was freezed a bit. At the same time I resolved several interesting tasks. I still need to do sport today. unfortunately I didn't have time for it in the morning. But I like do exercises just after waking up. Meditation still works to me. I like it. I had a nice lunch as well. I ordered some cool dished in Glovo. I usually don't write such tings. Also I try to restore posting to social media. Tomorrow is friday and this is also cool. I am a bit tiered of everything. I went back to normal condition but still feel bad sometimes. Anyway. This day is lovely.

# 17 March - Friday - Yerevan - 169 day of immigration

I've got good news today. My permanent residency is done. I'm going to meet Varsine on Monday and get it. It looks like I am a norman Armenian now. In every case it's good thing. All embassies that are located in Yerevan are open for me. I can ask for visas from Russia as well as from Armenia. It's totally something new for me to have additional residency. Due to the wat I still cannot predict the future. Absence of planning kills me. Nevertheless I did some stuff today. I watched several videos and significatly improved readme project. Tomorrow I am going to edit and publish new video. I will try to publish them every two weeks. I still cannot start writing english versions. I feel pathetic because of it. The weather in Yerevan is quite colder today. It rains everyday. This is sad thing. I very hope that the sun will go back to me. ANother interesting fun fact, I've just recall, it's approximately a year after my first leaving of Russia. That's still weird for me.

# 18 March - Saturday - Yerevan - 170 day of immigration

The main piece of news is that yesterday Putin was wanted by the international court of The Hague. It's something new. Now Russian president is toxic person. This is nice. Nevermind, today we went for a walk an had a nice day. We visited temporary market in the city center. I found Kovcheg project place there. They sells nice anti-war stickers. I will probably buy a couple of them. At the same time I crucially need to publish video tomorrow. I will receive permanent residency paper on Monday. Also I brought a trousers to tailor. This man will fix them and it will be also nice. We tested new restaurant today. It wasn't a good place and I don't remember it. In general this Saturday was nice. I hope that Sunday will be just as cool.

# 19 March - Sunday - Yerevan - 171 day of immigration

I publish another episode of the diary of emigration. I think it's the best one so far. I speak quite nice and picture is also cool. tomorrow I will receive my permanent residency of Armenia. It means that I will be something like local but without political rights. It's absolutely new role for me. I am really curios how it looks like. I mean document. Anyway It's a big event. Nonetheless me and ksusha understood that It will be not necessary to live here permanently. we decided that it's a good chance to relocate to Turkey again. We've been thinking about KASH city again. We were there onces and it was cool. Also it's really hight chance that we will change out European plans and after Rome will go to Germany. It's a good change moving to Antalia from Berlin without visiting of Yerevan again. From another side I did a lot of good things today. I studied read books and did another good activities. I also did sport.

# 20 March - Monday - Yerevan - 172 day of immigration

Today I got my residency permit. The only thing I need to do is registering myself in government office. In 5 years I will have a chance to get Armenian citizenship. It's obvious that it's not important for me.  Also I coded a lot today. I visited my surgeon, it two weeks I have a chance to start implantation. unfortunately It will be impossible. I'm going to Italy and Spain at 22th of April. After this trip I will flight to Antalia, Turkey and live there for a while. Only after these things, probably it two months I will go back to Armenia. It's not critical for me, I'm used to living without teeth. Tomorrow I will go to Podologist and this will be the last my visit. I am pissed off of them. I will biy something in pharmacy. It will be help me more I suppose.

# 21 March - Tuesday - Yerevan - 173 day of immigration

Podologis finally asked me to do some things and my treatment will be finished. I had an interview today with Yassir company. another company asked me to reschedule SITA or SATA. I don't remember the title. I tried to code today but the half of the day I spent in the city if an effort to fisnish some business. I still need to do sport despite the fact that it's quite late. The mood is good today. I feel much better these days. Me and Ksusha are still thinking about visit to Berlin. But it will be expensive. We need to finalize the design this weekend. I really haven't decided what to do yet.

# 22 March - Wednesday - Yerevan - 174 day of immigration

Well, Recharge company rejected me. It's sad because it was a great opportunity for immigration. I fucked up the interview. Other interview didn't happen. HR just forgot about me. It was made by audibene company. Definitely this day wasn't so good. I resolved several tasks from leetcode and started diving deeper to javascript essentials. I still working in Holy theory project and I will proceed working on it. At the same time I found two great repositories with reactjs and javascript questions. I will proceed working on it. despite the amount of bad things today I did sport. I try to do exercises every day. I really want to be healthier, moreover I feel how my mood become better after these starts. I like it. Only thing I need to do it meditation. I will do it right after finishing this line. See you tomorrow. 

# 23 March - Thursday - Yerevan - 175 day of immigration

My mood is not so good. After yesterdays news I am bad. surely I proceeded doing things but I don't feel much energy. At the same time It's much more clear that we will go to Germany in the end of April. I don't have emotions for future search. I feel like burned out person. I can try to change it but it's hard. I feel so tiered that I cannot find a power for sport today. I'll do it anyway, but so. Tomorrow is friday and this is amazing. We are going to the cinema tomorrow and the day after tomorrow. I hope it will be nice. Ksusha is going to Russia on Monday. the next week will be stressful for me. I don't like to be alone.

# 24 March - Friday - Yerevan - 176 day of immigration

We were on John Wick again. It was nice but too long. Too much. It was nice action but average quality movie. In the middle of the day I had a conversation from woman that works for NN bank. They are looking for engineering manager. They cannot pay a lot but I need more experience of interviews. So I will get it next week. I also did some good things for my projects. I try to do daily improvements.  Today I finally added partially generated by myself description to github. I still in schedule about holy theory. I do things every day. Also I did sport and meditation as usual.

# 25 March - Saturday - Yerevan - 177 day of immigration

We were on Blade Runner 2 today.
