# 01 July - Saturday - Yerevan - Gyumri- 275 day of immigration

We were in Gyumri today. We bought tickets to local train in advance and used this transport. IT was nice for about 2 hours trip from Yerevan to Gyumri and the same time back. This city is quite old and had name Adrianapol and Leninakan before. This titles are from Russian empire and USSR accordingly. It is quite nice city that is absolutely perfect for one time visit. I don't think that I will go back to the place. We checked several local cafes and restaurants, visited several places of interests and had a good time. I really enjoyed this trip. I made 20000 steps today and my legs are buzzing now. It's crazy. Another nice thing is that I did a lot of duo linguo exercises in train and read several pages of Lord of the rings. I barely have time for reading and sometimes I am really happy to do it. It very relaxes me. I still believe that reading is the best way to train fantasy. You have only words and some mood. All pictures you build in mind by yourself. Yea. This day was nice. I hope that tomorrow will be at least the same. Will see.

# 02 July - Sunday - Yerevan - 276 day of immigration

I started learning fastapi today. It's python's library that help to do simple api's. I really want to learn this language despite the fact that I hated it before. Anyway I need to push my brain to think and analyze a new information. This is important. I also prepared some materials for the future test task that I need to finish withing the next two days. I will wake up much earlier because of it. The next week will be hard because I really need to do much more than usual. First of all I need to finish a lot of DR SMILE's tasks. Second of all I need to be prepared to interviews. And finally I need to increase a holy theory developing pace. Now it's silly. I am not satisfied by it. At the same time we will live in another apartments soon and this is amazing. The rest of the day we were walking and went shopping. I bought shower gel and eyeglass frame online. It will be here soon and I will go to optical shop and do new glasses. My current onces are not so good anymore. 

# 03 July - Monday - Yerevan - 277 day of immigration

So, I was investigating python Fast Api framework, react flow and some other things. I did it because I need to finish some tasks soon. At the same time I had a nice conversation with Fedor head of engineering. I asked some questions and got some answers. I have something to think right now. I am very tiered today and feel lack of energy. I cannot explain what happened but I feel bad. Maybe tomorrow I will be better I don't know. Right now the life is not so nice as before. But before it also wasn't so nice. Sitting in the place that you don't want to sit is sucks. Every time when I think that I am ok I understand that actually not. Shitty shit is still here. I hate it. I want my life to be changed to better direction. Doctoflix didn't answer anything to me. It's absolutely disappointment moment. I expected nice attitude but I see that they are shit.

# 04 July - Tuesday - Yerevan - 278 day of immigration

Today I had two shitty interview that I think it was waste of time. I am in bad mood for the last days. So, I was programming for whole day. I still tried to fin ways how to finish with test task for one company. Tomorrow is the latest day when I can do it. I need to wake up earlier that usual for this purposes. Flow framework looks very interesting. I hope that tomorrow I will finish with it and switch to python back. Now I just want to have a rect and do nothing for a couple hours.

# 05 July - Wednesday - Yerevan - 279 day of immigration

I'm extremely tiered today. I slept horrible. It was headache and I was able to sleep only after taking a pill. For whole day I was fighting to nextjs framework. It was hard and annoying thing. I needed to do it in order to make a coding test for one of the companies. I hope everything will be good. I also had two interviews today. HTe first one is with unpredictable result and the second one was just waste of time. Also I know that our backend developer Anton will leave the company soon. It's bad because he's quite smart and knows everything about the system. It'll be huge lost of the team and for the company in general. He's absolutely demotivated by company's behavior. It's crazy but company does everything to loose him. Now I will go and have dinner. after that I just want ot have a smooth and lazy evening. Will see.

# 06 July - Thursday - Yerevan - 280 day of immigration

I was coding for whole day. It was a hell. I also lost a lot of time this morning in dentist clinic. It was also horrible. I almost finished with some test task that one company asked me to do. I will send it to them tomorrow. I also need to finish some important drsmile tasks. It will be tomorrow. I don't want to thing about it now. Tomorrow I will go to the new apartment. My landlord will give me keys and on Saturday we will move to that place. I'm exacted really. It'll be my first long term home here. This is amazing I'm really tiered. I also finally will get teeth on Monday. It's cool. It was a long journey. Now i will go and have a rest.

# 07 July - Friday - Yerevan - 281 day of immigration

I got keys for my new apartments today. We are going to that place tomorrow. I met landlord and did all paper and other type of work. I send another test task in the morning. I wish to get a feedback soon. The rest of the day I was programming and tried to resolve different problems. last two weeks are crazy. I barely can find time for a lot of things. I still cannot do video about Barcelona. IT's shit. When we got internet at new home I will do it. Another thing is that I like my current apartment much more. There is more space and more rooms and bedroom huge. It's sad. But I cannot afford them.

# 08 July - Saturday - Yerevan - 282 day of immigration

Today we moved to another apartments. This thing happened smooth and we did everything in time. Also we decided trying to be on mobile internet because the home one here is quite expensive. Armenia is't cheap country in this sense. We also visited one local mall and bought some important equipment. It's another part because now I feel some root that grow from me into Armenia. We also discuessed possible next steps for relocation. there is nothing easy. It will be hard. I still don't want to live in Russia. I hate everything that happens there. It's horrible place for living. Authorities don't think about people. The only importance is their reputation and money. I hate everything like this. Because of them my life ruined and confused. I hate it as well. Newermind. I updated holy theory today significantly. I will focus on thing tomorrow.
