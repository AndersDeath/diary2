# 01 December - Thursday - Gündoğan - 63 day of immigration

Today is 2 months since i left Russia. I still feel bad. I really dream about a moment when I can be in good mood and calm. I feel that I am extrimely tiered of the situation. I know that much more people in worse situation that me, but I feel it as it is. I am also extrimely tiered of the working for DR SMile. It seems that I am very close to be burned out. 

Despite the my mood I try to do things in time. I go through my todolist, don't forget about lessons, and try to study something everyday. I try to find stability in my mind, but honestly I feel everything so useless. I don't want live in this shit.

Sometimes I even think about going back to Russia and trying to find job there. Only fear of death holds me from it. I think I need to come up with some strategy for future asap. In other case I will go crazy. 

Only one thing exists - everything will be ok. I believe in it.

# 02 December - Friday - Gündoğan - Turgutreis - 64 day of immigration

It's really cool that we got new jaket for Ksusha today. The thing we had going to Turgutreis for it. But this is no a problem. The problem is absence of jaket. The Turgutreis bus was filled by young studenst of local Gundogan school. Surprisingy the behaived well. Alsot because of the 20 000 000 revenew of DR SMILE I have a half day off. It's really funny, but I am grad to have it anyway.
