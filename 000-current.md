# 01 June - Thursday - Kaş - 245 day of immigration

Someone found my github with tons of commits and deicide that I don't do job and just push something to repositories. It's something new in my career. I considered it as a risk when I started doing this project. I mean holy theory project. I don't care what others think about it. I'm completely tiered of this stuff and I cannot carry it anymore. Maybe I think a lot more about it that I should. Anyway I need to fix this situation somehow. I think I need to share what I do to others. I will start from Fedor tomorrow and then maybe share it with Olga. After that I want ti make a call with my team and share this to them. Let's see what will happen. I need to show myself as a strong person that is absolutely sure in his believes. So, I am such person. I think I will fix the problem this way. I hope so.

# 02 June - Friday - Kaş - 246 day of immigration

I talked to Fedor today. He is absolutely ok with things that I do. On Monday I will talk to Olga about my activities and try to resolve the situation. It's really hard to do anything when you have doubts. However I had a nice call with one startup today which has cool conception and I want to try myself in the next interview. Surprisingly they support relocation which is amazing. I hope that I will pass an interview with them because the process is quite simple. But let see. It's not so clear now. Besides that this day was nice and did a lot of things. The mood wasn't so good but I am cool. Tomorrow is holiday and I am happy about that. It will help me to refresh.

# 03 June - Saturday - Kaş - 247 day of immigration

Today I tried to record pppodcast. For some reasons the sound recorded poor and I should to redo it without external mic. At the same time it's the last saturday in this trip to Turkey. We were on beautiful beach. The weather is quite windy today and we didn't swim. Actually we didn't swim at all due to the weather. It's not so good as last year. However I spent great time on it. I was thinking a lot about programming again. I do pretty well in this area for the last time. I'm happy about it. At the same time my condition and mood became much better. Step by step I adopt to new lifestyle that I have to have. I still worry about my ability to pass technical interviews. I will have the nearest one in the wednesday. It will be some kind of crash test for me. I ruined the latest test that I got from Parkos. It's because I thought that I am able to do something in vuejs. In fact I wasn't and just spent 2.30 hour without good result. Bad result is also nice but still. So, now I will go to have a dinner. I am quite hungry today. I spent a couple hours driving and it tiered me. So, I will go. See you tomorrow people.

# 04 June - Sunday - Kaş - 248 day of immigration

This day was nice. We had a nice walk in the town and on peninsula. The weather was extremely hot. All people went to beach and it was impossible to fide a place for freshing up. At the same time I did nothing and just had a rest. On Tuesday night I will be already in Yerevan. I want to come back to the city. We decided to rent an apartments for a long time. I'm happy that we did it. Actually apartments in Yerevan became much chipper that I expected. It's possible to rent an apartment in the city center for reasonable price. Immigration wave stopped. The only thing that I don't like in Yerevan is absence of the sea. It's sad really. I hope that everything will be ok and we leave car successfully and flight will be smooth. Last time I lost so much nerves that I don't want to repeat it again. Another fun fact is that Ksusha started using chatgpt and she likes it. It's nice and something new. I hope that it'll help her a lot. All these AI stuff is very interesting. I will dive into it more and more.

# 05 June - Monday - Kaş - 249 day of immigration

Today I had a nice talk to Olga about the situation with Holy Theory. I will do the next talk with my team tomorrow. I gonna share the information about it and try to convince them that this project is absolutely side. At the same time today the last full day in Kash for us. WE are going to Yerevan tomorrow. We will be there in the middle of the night. I'm happy to come back to Yerevan. We are going to rent an apartments for long term. I want to collect some money until the autumn starts. This savings will be nice in case of relocation. Comstruct fucked me. The CTO guy convinced me that the wanted to send an interview invitation, but he lied. I sent an email to him and his rejected me. Such a bastard. So, anyway I will have an technical interview in wednesday. I'll do in from Yerevan's apartments. I hope an internet connection will be find, but we'll see.
