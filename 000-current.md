# 01 June - Thursday - Ka≈ü - 245 day of immigration

I thought a lot today about the fact that only we can understand us well. I mean that nobody can understand real motivation and stuff that happens inside in our minds. I would be curious to know what Ksusha things about herself. Surely she can tell me, but I don't think that I can undersand the real picture. the same rule works to me. Anyway I had an interesting interview for engineering position in one of the Berlins startups. it's also medical stuff and they rose a round now. It's huge potential in this company. Unfortunately I am again not sure about my knowledge. I am not a robot and cannot handle all topics that exists in programming world. Also I constantly don't remember simple stuff. Even today I had a questions about data strutures and I have a notes about it in my special notebook but I forgot about it and didn't look at this. It's sad. I will fix it in the future.
