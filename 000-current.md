# 01 Februar - Donnerstag - Berlin - 499 Tag der Einwanderung

Уникальный момент. Я обычно не пишу дневник на русском, но сегодня решил воспользоваться великим и могучим. Вообще у меня есть мысль снова перейти на русский язык в ведении дневка. По большей части я хочу это сделать для того чтобы иметь возмодность лучше раскрыть свои мысли. Ну и объем увеличится кратно. Итак, сегодня я был в офисе. Я провер ретроспективу для своих коллег и кажется им понравилось. Также я ходил со своим начальником прогуляться по району и болтал о разном. В первый раз такое было. Помимо этого есть высокая вероятность что я поеду в Манхайм на следующей неделе. Дело в том, что меня пригласили на онсайт интервью. Я думаю что это хорошая возможность размяться и вообще посмотреть что там происходит в проекте. Это небольшой стартап, который планирует начать производство и мне это интересно. Вообще, тут огромное количество стартапов и я хочу участвовать в них, это может мне позволить неплохо развиться в финансовом и не только план. Логичто что я хочу развиваться и зарабатывать. Для этого я приехал сюда. Вообще настроение неплохое, рабочие забрали поломанную стиральную машину и мы скоро закажем новую. Спалось на новой квартире хорошо. До сих пор не вериться что это мой новый дом. Есть что-то странное в том что я живу теперь в Берлине.

# 08 Februar - Donnerstag - Berlin - 506 Tag der Einwanderung

I can say that I'm bored by this diary. I do this more than a  year. In april it will be two years that I write down my thouhts here. Initiall I wanted to use this notes for a kinda therapy but it turned to the just logbook. So, I think that I need to find a way how to move it to some other direction. Anyways. let's go back to things that happened today. so I was working as usual and everything was nice. The main goal for today was to change registration here. we wnt to Pankow burgeramt and was surpeised by absend of signature in the confirmation that we live in this apartments. It's so crazy that I cannot balieve in it. It's so shitty shit. Unfortunately we found it in the clerk's cabinet. It's so shitty. Luckily Ksusha obtained a termin for the next teusday. I am happy about it. I will call to the landlord and ask to sign the document. This is very important because we have eveything for getting residency.
