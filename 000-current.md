# 01 December - Friday - Berlin - 437 day of immigration

Today I visit the XU office and met all people there. It was nice conversation and onboarding in general. I enjoyed it a lot. It was filly office day but with some cool things. They gave me a working laptop, which is very nice and also they gave me some souvenirs like branded bottle, book, and other things. Additionally they gave me wireless keyboard and mouse control which I will not use probably because it's not so useful. But anyway I took it because I don't refuse anything if people give me something valuable. Also drsmile offboarding is absolutely weird. They didn't send me an email or some list of things that I need to do - nothing. It's very weird. I hope they are ok with it because HR's know about my quitting. Also I sad good buy to my bonus because they just didn't sign any paper and I suppose that they will fuck me. Maybe not, but I will know about it in three of four months probably. The weather in Berlin is very cold which is not good but understandable. Locals are in panic because it's rare -6 degrees. Also I will start to clear my laptop tomorrow. I need to remove a lot of things from the place.

# 02 December - Saturday - Berlin - 438 day of immigration

Today I was near ex-berlin wall where one artist draw a brezhven kissed a leader of DDR. It is extremely famous picture. Also there is a picture of Academic Sakharov that participated in invention of extremely powerful Tzar bomb. In general this place is very interesting. After that we went to a gallery in Nounk√∂ln. What a shitty place I have to say. Additionally I saw in metro a Ukranian guy that tried to fight to a russian that was not ok for this person. What a bullshit. He looked like a gopnik, really. The we came back home. Another shit is that DHL guy decided to deliver our package to some neighbor that we don't know. It's crazy. This order was paid and stuff. I cannot understand this shit, really. How is it possible? I don't believe that it's normal. Tomorrow we are going to visit museum of communication. I expect it to be interesting. Another cool thing is that I writing it using keyboard that my new company gave me. It's cool. Yesterday I forgot to mention that I am on two final stages of interview processes. It's so new and cool. I really like it. It's really hight chance that I will visit Frankfurt next week. I am not going to work there but it's cool.

# 03 December - Sunday - Berlin - 439 day of immigration

The museum of communication was nice. We spent an hour there and it was cool. Also we found a cool vietnamese restaurant. It was tasty and nice. The half of the day we spent at home because each of us has big dept. Tomorrow we are going to sparcasse wich is big german ban. It's needed to us opening an account there in order to get salary. So, I hope it will be smooth. Will see. Also tomorrow is the first working day for me. Sure I had a day on Friday but only tomorrow I will start doing actual things. Basically it will be an onboarding day. I need to fill some information on personio and set up all important environment for work. I hope it will be also easy. laptop they gave me is better than mine but I don't know how it will actually work. It's 14 inches Macbook pro 2021 on m1 processor. I have 13 inches macbook pro 2020 on m1 as well. Also I will have some additional information about future interview and other different cool things.

# 04 December - Monday - Berlin - 440 day of immigration

Today we were in sparkasse and actually they opened an account to me. It's really good news. Also vivid band opened another account which is nice as well. I will go and pull some money to it because I have to pay for the delivery. It's sad but necessary. I still want to have a bank card that will work everywhere inside and outside of Europe. I still cannot understand fully that I am in Germany. It's crazy. In general I cannot say that I totally feel the positive difference. This place is much safer that Russia. It also has a lot of weird problems like transport, service, and so on. At the same time salaries and the middle level of life is much better the
