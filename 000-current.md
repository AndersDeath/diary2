# 01 November - Wednesday - Yerevan - 398 day of immigration

Today I was working on entities for my nx setup. It was interesting and nice. I'm going to finish working on it. BRsided that I was learning German and doing other things. I pissed off of dR SMILE. These morons didn't send money to me again. It makes me really angry. I really want to finish working for them as soon as possible. I pissed off. Also I found how to reach out railway station in Dortmund. It will be easier than I expect because this place has shuttle bus from airport to railway station. It's really nice and not so expensive. Just 10 euros and I am there. In general my vacation goes smooth. I have time to work on many things I spend this time smart. Also me and Ksusha were in cafe today. We got lunch and worked from that place. In couple of minutes we will go to the cinema. Yep, Vacation goes well. I like it.

It's just needed to be mentioned. Also we were in the cinema yesterday in the evening. we watched Killers of the Flower Moon. It's a movie about white americans that were ready for everything for getting oil fields from native americans. It's really powerful picture. I highly recommend to look at it. Today I was doing usual things according my daily plan.Additionally I build a special version of telegram bot that helps me in learning of german words. It was important thing. Also I visited my Podologist, maybe last time. I am not sure that I will got to get at 14 of November. Probably I will just cancel this schedule. Tomorrow I will proceed working on my usual things.
