# 01 May - Monday - Barcelona - 214 day of immigration

Today we were in the park that was in Parfumer movie. There is a labyrinth there. It's quite nice place and I was surprised. we also were at plau de la musica which is one of the first modernizm buildings in Barcelona. The rest of the day we spent at home. I also definitely have to proceed with sport and meditation. I also was coding with pleasure today. It's quite rare situation. I also finally finished with Holy Theory metadata adding. It's cool. The documentation for holy theory generator is also finished. It will be a short and simple javascript program which helps to prepare data for eleventy and just simple readme file. I will come back to walking. I went to Barcelona's beach and had a nice time there. Ksusha stayed at home and I was there alone. Anyway it was a pleasure. I was listening to techno and other music.

# 02 May - Tuesday - Barcelona - 215 day of immigration

This day was a good. We didn't walk a lot and I am not so tiered. I can say the same about Ksusha. I had an interview with Happeo guy. It was nice and short. I also did sport and meditation that is amazing because for the last several weeks I didn't have power to do it. I decided now that I have one sacred hour for my body every day. I need to change my body shape. I think that it is a time. I am 35 years old and my body and health will never be better but only worse. So, it's my goal. In general I finished with almost all tasks from my list. Also I started enjoying Barcelona.  Initially my impression wasn't so good, but now everything is ok and I can say that my opinion changed in some ways. I want to listen to source video about this city shortly and then decide if I need to record some another part for some reasons.

# 03 May - Wednesday - Barcelona - 216 day of immigration

So, I am sitting in Buenos Migas place which is one of the places where it is possible to eat for affordable price in this city. I tried to rerecord my video about Barcelona this morning but I got only piece of shit. Local streets are extremely noisy and I didn't find a place where I can be in calm env. I also changed a plan for the video. Now it has strong structure that I want to try the next morning. From another side this day was quite calm. The day after tomorrow in the nearest friday we are leaving this city. the first stop will be Rome, that Dortmund. After that we are going to use douchebahn and enter to Berlin. In general this vacation is quite cool because I finally looked at Spain through key whole. In general I got good impressions about this country. MAybe it's because I like Spanish language though. Neverming I got good time. The first week was hard but now I am ok and ready to start doing new great things.

# 04 May - Thursday - Barcelona - 217 day of immigration

Today we finally to CosmoCaixa. It's a museum on science in Barcelona that was founded by loca Caixa bank. I hope I typed this title correctly. It's a cool place awith interactive things and fishes and ancient animals. I wish to had such place when I was a kid. I also finally recorded all video sources. The latest attempt wasn't so good. Tomorrow I'm going to start editing of this stuff. We also was in Hard Rock cafe. Barcelona's version sucks. Yerevan's one is much better. We also started to look for an apartments in Yerevan for summer when I have to go there in order to finish with my teeth. Hopefully I will have the full set if them this summer. At the same time I found a bit time for studying today and worked on nuxtjs understanding. this technology is quite interesting. I don't like vuejs in general but I can say that it's simple for understanding. I forgot to mention that this day is the final full one in this trip to Spain. We are flying to Rome tomorrow evening. After one night and short stay we will go Dortmund. I've never been there and it will quite interesting experience for me.

# 05 May - Friday - Barcelona - 218 - day of immigration

We are flying to Rome today and tomorrow's morning we will be in Dortmund for one night. Unfortunately today is strike in barcelona and our flight will be delayed for one hour. I apparently don't like it but cannot do anything. It's 17:37 o'clock and in several minutes I will have a call with some German company. It'll be a short introduction call. It should be this morning but guy from that company asked me to move time. Unfortunately I have only one convenient slot and it's it. I also had a time for coding today. It's also quite cool. I improved holy-theory generator which makes me happy. I think to move some functionality of it into Kentron library because this thing does very similar stuff. The only difference that Kentron has its own templating system but in holy-theory I decided to use pug.

# 06 May - Saturday - Rome/Fiumicino - 219 - day of immigration

It was one of the hardest flights in my life. In barcelona was a strike and my airplane departures without baggage. we spent the whole night in the airport. Airbnb guy fucked us up and just stopped answering. In beginning our flight was delayed for two hours. Than we set intro the airplane but after landing the capitan said that our baggage was arrived partially. But it was a lie because there wasn't any luggage. Capitan couldn't not to know about it. It was lie. Then I spent a lot of time with papers and airport stuff. Basically all germany visit will be cancelled. Everything goes wrong because of them. I will not visit Dortmund and the same will be for Berlin I suppose. I feel really bad because of it. I have to wait my luggage and don't know how long. I am sue that I will return my goods but all this shit makes me very nervous. Finally I need to stay in a fucking motel near airport. I will think about it.

# 07 May - Sunday - Rome/Fiumicino - 220 - day of immigration

We was in Ikea today and it was beautiful. We tasted some delicious ikea food. I missed it so much. Basically we spent the whole day in that shopping mall. Now we are in the motel. I still have a hope that my luggage will be put to today's flight and delivered to Rome. Otherwise we have to be here more. It's also extremely expensive to be here. The price is about 100 euros for night. 10 days and I am bankrupt. It's really nervous situations. I was out of comfort so much last year when I had to leave Russia. In this kind of moment I feel really how I miss my apartments in Murino. I miss mother, granny, aunt, Nastya and others. It's painful. I really want Russian authorities to be changed. I really want to go back home but I still remember why I left country. I want to be alive much more. I want to have a rest from moving from place to place. I wanted to have a nice vacation but as a result I got stressed situation. I didn't have a rest actually. At the end I again try to fix issues.

# 08 May - Monday - Fiumicino/Ostia - 221 - day of immigration

we didn't get oug luggage. Fucking wizzair and barcelona didn't send it to Rome. We moved to an apartments. This place is quite cozy. We decided that if tomorrow our baggage will not be sent We will go to Barcelona and try to get in on place. Ksusha is extremely devastated. I support her as I can. I will not go to Berlin. It's too expensive. I hate it. In general I am extremely tiered of this situation. I really don't want going to fucking Barcelona. I want to just be relaxed a bit. Fuck them all.

# 09 May - Tuesday - Ostia - 222 day of immigration

We finally got our luggage. It happened in the first part of the day. So, we lost about 1000 euros because of this strike and Wizzair. Tomorrow we are going to Antalia. Finally I can be relaxed. The next months will be probably very calm. Anyway I feel much better. My vacation is over by the way but I need to take a day off tomorrow due to the flight. We are flying to destination point with one stop in Istanbul. There are no tickets from Rome that can move us directly. It's not so sad, but it means that tomorrow will be another airport day. Finally we are going to drive to the place by car. We will rent it for one months. It's nice because I really miss driving. I didn't drive a car for more that half a year. At the same time I really like to do this. we also walked in this neighborhood of Ostia. It's a nice place. I really enjoyed this walk because there is a beach and miditerrian sea. Our host is amazing person. He gave keys to us much earlier that we expected yesterday. Today he picked us up in airport which was extremely convenient. I liked it. He is a project manager in Byer company and he's responsible for their logistics systems which is very interesting.

# 10 May - Wednesday - Rome - Istanbul - Antalia - Kas - 223 day of immigration

We finally landed to Turkey. this is amazing. Very soon I will get a car and we will go to apartments. I really dream about nice months. After that we will go to Yerevan back. So, Today's flights were pleasant and calm. We left Rome in the morning and spent 2 hours in Istanbul in transit. Everything went smooth. Now I we have been waiting for our luggage. I also had an interview in airport with one company. Those people lied to me on the first call. I definitely don't want to work for them. At the same time I see mismatch between us. Tomorrows call will be much more important. I hope to do it well. I will wake up earlier in order to do some preparations. I need to talk about vuejs to them which is not my main technology. Anyway I will try to do my best. I also very tiered of everything and will be happy to spent some good time here. I really have this opportunity this time. I don't want when I will go back to Europe after this stress.

# 11 May - Thursday - Ka≈ü - 224 day of immigration

I enjoy staying here. It's amazing and calm place. I was working nicely today and it was amazing. Apartment is amazing and very cozy. We also went to town for having a small dinner. It was quite expensive but not bad. I also had an interesting interview with Parkos company. I am not sure that I passed it. I also think that I need to dive deeper to looking for vacancies because Ksusha mostly working on it and I see that she is very tiered of it. She is on the edge. I also got good review during PCDR process. It's good and now I am much more confident. I also need to work more on presentation on myself. So, I still fighting for my future. I don't want to stop doing things. By the way I also need to start working on video. I will start working on it tomorrow.

# 12 May - Friday - Ka≈ü - 225 day of immigration

This day was full of meetings. I talked a lot about different things to many people. It was quite nice and cool. I relaxed finally. Last week was really hard and I felt really bad. Now everything is much better. I was writing code and did a lot of interesting things today. It was a pleasure to dive back into work. I think that only activities help me not to go crazy. I still feel empty inside due to the war and the fact that I cannot go back home. I really miss my place. I think only now I understood a value of having home. I didn't think about it before and I even didn't expect that it might be so hard to live without understanding and feeling of home. I know that one day I will have the my own place. Unfortunately I cannot expect when it might happen. Nevermind. 

# 13 May - Saturday - Ka≈ü - 226 day of immigration

Nothing happened yet. It's 11.20 o'clock and we are going to some small palace which is in 40 minutes driving from here. I hope that this travel will be smooth and good. Now I only want to be calm and have a good rest today. I already finished some tasks in the morning and I hope that I will be able to do others as well. I feel nervous again. Maybe because I just don't want to spend the whole day in the car. So, the next lines I will add in the evening.

So, it's 20.26 o'clock. We came back home. We were in two places including patara beach which is amazing. I had a nice day with Ksusha. I don't write a lot about her. Maybe it's time. I am extremely lucky guy because I have such beautiful girl. I love her so much. We've been together for 9 years. For almost 2 years we are in marriage. Again I am lucky guy and I try to do everything to make her happy. this is extremely hard period of our life. In fact we could live in Russia because only me in danger but she decided to go out of the country with me. I know that she also don't want to be there. She told me that she did it for herself. This is true. But she also has choice. I love her.

# 14 May - Sunday - Ka≈ü - 227 day of immigration

Today I had a lot of time for my own personal development and things. I like such days. We are sitting in a cafe in Kash and do deals on our Laptops. I dressed as an old person. I updated readme project finally and it's amazing. I also updated introduction for my new interviews. I want to try express myself better. It's very important thing that I usually lose. Also the weather is amazing and my mood is also good due to it. Honestly I feel better in general. It looks like I relaxed more here that during my European tour. Turkey is nice place for it. By the way it's election day here in Turkey. Even more: it's presidential elections. Erdogan can lose his chair today. It depends on if he's ready to make a bloodbath here. We will know in few days about it.

# 15 May - Monday - Ka≈ü - 228 day of immigration

This day was quite busy. I did release in DR SMILE which is nice. I also released holy-theory project and finally finished with data generator for readme project. I didn't have time for the last one, but I finally found time. I also had an interview with weird company. A woman couldn't explain what the do to me. I'm really disappointed in them. Tomorrow will be also busy day. I hope nothing bad will happen. I received a request to call with Parkos company that is bad sign. Their manager told me that he sent me a test task but he didn't and now someone wants talking to me. this is bad. I think they will just refuse me. I had a great conversation with Oleg yesterday. He still tries to break a window to Portugal. He almost got all documents for asking for visa. I don't know how it will go to him. Additionally the apartment prices in Portugal are extremely high. They are around 3500-4000 eur for months. This is crazy. I get 5500-6000 eur per months and this is good salary but even me cannot afford it. The situation is crazy.

# 16 May - Tuesday - Ka≈ü - 229 day of immigration

This day was quite nice but absolutely confusing. I had tons of meeting and I feel I did nothing. It's not true but still. So I also had a call with Parkos guy. I expected some shitburger but surprisingly the man told me about coding assessment. It looks like I need to dive deeper to nuxtjs during this week. I need to dedicate two hours of my time for this task on weekend. I don't know maybe I will do on Saturday or Sunday. Anyway I's good news and need to postpone some things that were planned for this week due to preparations. The weather here is amazing. It's really tropical summer here even though it's still spring outside. So, In general this day was busy but not so hard.

# 17 May - Wednesday - Ka≈ü - 230 day of immigration

I finally cooked fucking Docker container for nuxtjs today. It wasn't so easy I need to say. Firstly I didn't do this before, secondly there is a lot of shitty information on the internet that is hard to filter. However I did it and I am quite happy. At the same time I did some important tasks for DR SMILE that is good. Because of all good things my mood is also good. It looks like I will have interesting test task and cool project in DR SMILE as well. Surely It's not so obvious but anyway. It looks like I am very close to getting new knowledge. I'm quite tiered of Angular and I don't want to work with technology anymore. In a couple of day I want to setup Stable Diffusion local version to my laptop and make several tests. If all good I will do some pictures that will public somewhere. It will be interesting.

# 18 May - Thursday - Ka≈ü - 231 day of immigration

Today I was working for whole day and it was nice. I am really tiered but satisfied. Tomorrow I will have short interview with a company, but before that I need to focus on DR SMILE tasks. IF I have time I will read more about nuxtjs and to make some preparations to test task that Parkos should send me shortly. Let's see. In general things go well. The weather today is extremely windy. IT's not so nice as a couple of days before. I think to wear better outfit. In general I feel good and this is amazing. I hope to find new job soon despite the fact that I've been looking for it for 4 month.

# 19 May - Friday - Ka≈ü - 232 day of immigration

This day was quite heavy. I'm really tiered and I really want to have a rest. luckily it's friday. We will got to Fethiye tomorrow. We want to visit supermarket and just walk around. It's big town up north from Kash. I like that place as well. It was my first place for relatively long staying here in Turkey. From job perspective I did a lot of things. I don't want to write a lot of words today. I will just go and relax.

# 20 May - Friday - Ka≈ü - Fethiye - 234 day of immigration

Today we were in Fethie which is nice place. I like this city very much. Ksusha doesn't like this place and this is rare situation when our preferables are different. The car that we rented issued today. In some moment is just stopped working. Fortunately I asked help to some locals and they did it. They called to renting company and they just asked to reboot cars brain. I am happy of it. I also did some programming that is amazing. I need to do some test for Parkos. I hope I will do it well but let see. I don't know what to expect. I did some preparations and them should help.
