# 01 November - Tuesday - Gündoğan - 33 day of immigration

I decided to count immigration days a month ago. I think it's important to remember the time of the new life. I consider that my previouse life has been end. And not only my life, but many people from Russia, Belarus and Ukrain had to change everything. The couse is obviouse - the war. I will call it the war despite the fact that it's prohibited in Russia. I also remembered that yesterday Ksusha found chamelion on roof terrace. It's so an interesting animal. It catched a chair and put it near a tree and chamelion moved to the tree this morning. Also I learned portuguese today and code a lot. When I was going to the shop I recorded another video about immigration. I will process itg and upload to youtube in the next morning. I'm very tiered today. It's really hard day. I woke up too early in the morning and didn't rest enough. I will go to sleep in time today.

# 02 November - Wednesday - Gündoğan - 34 day of immigration

Today I was working mostly on educatin and programming stuff. I finished with a lot of things. I woke up in time and immidiently started learing things. Also I published third video on my youtube channgel. I was speaking about internal immigration. I like to record videos it's just fun. I am trying to make myself better evey day. Luckily today I feel better than yesterday. I slept well. By the way I found photo studio which can take photos for green card lottery. It's very good. Tomorrow we are going to that place and after that we are going to fill the statement. I still have a hope to win that lottery. Sometimes I think a lot about immigation to USA. That country is not ideal, but I looks pretty predictable and understandable. It's about 17.00 o'clock. I am quite tiered and honestly really want to have a rest. We bought some local meatballs that I want to cook after a meeting where I am hanging now. It's Treatment expierence meeting. Tomorrow byt the wat I will finish with survey bullshit and just after that I will start working on photo shooting mechanism. It will be really interesting. I am also extriemly exited about boat trip that will be next saturday. It's a part of my old deam about becaming a yaht capitan. Other than that I've just recalled about getting apartments in Yerevan for three months in total and for 10 day in Tbilisi. So, In general I am satisfied by myself, because every day I do something that move me closer to my main goal. I want to be rich and smart at the same time.

# 03 November - Thursday - Gündoğan - 35 day of immigration

I made a small bot helper which will help me with prtuguese learning. The clue is that this bot sends words every 5 minutes. I can just read messages and repeat words. also I finished with validation of required fields in survey engine. Tommorow is the public holiday in Russia. We are going to walk in another city that is near ours one. I also trained math and management today. TOday I feel that I am tiered. It's interesting that I don't know what to write, because not so many events happened. Honestly it's cool. I thing that makes me calm. The only thing that worries me now. I don't have cool and comfortable chair. It will be the first thing that I will buy after getting home.

# 04 November - Firday - Gündoğan - GÜMÜŞLÜK - 36 day of immigration

We visited gumusluk today. It's a small town in 30 minutes from home. We spent about 2 hours there and then came back to gundogan. Today I've built workable version of my telegram bot that can help me to remember portuguese words. I prepeared a image generator and now the bot sends not just strings but images with a word and a translation. It looks better as well. Tomorrow we are going to trip on a boat in turgutreis. I realy exatied about it. Unfortunately it means that I need to weak up erlier than I usually do in on saturdays. But it's the only way. If you think about other business then I did nothing today. At the same time I eat a beautiful desert in gumusluk. Also It was last time when I visited that place. It's really nothing to do in this place. So. Now I will go to prepare myself to sleep. Thank you.

# 05 November - Saturday - Gündoğan - Turgutreis - 37 day of immigration

Yesterday I imporove bot assistend which will help me with learning Portuguese language. it's really nice. So, Today we ride a yaht. It was airbnb expierence. It was the first time when we bought it. Kapitan was very nice person. Luckly he knows english very well and we didn't have communication problems with him. We rent it for 3 hour but in fact our trip was about 4 ones. It's really cool. We discussed politics, economy, and how to drive yaht. I even tried to rule it. In the middle of the trip capitan Rizo cooked a lunch for us. It was simple.but cool. I rally want to buy this kind of boat to ,yself. It looks like a dream.

I also had a long call with Oleg today. We discussed visa quesiton and our lives in general. he is a smart guy, but sometimes I see how it's hard for him to analyze the situation. It's a part of his personality. I know him gor a whole life and our friendshipt matters a lot for me. I wish him all the best. He is like a brother for me. honestly I miss him very much.

Yesterday there was a earthquake in Izmir. Today Is the same near Rodos island that is very close to me. It's fun but I feel how our house is shaking a bit. Firstly I thought that I just drunk to much wine today on the boat, but it's not. It's the first time in my life when i feel earthquake things. Far enough, now I will go to watch a series. 

# 06 November - Sunday - Gündoğan - 38 day of immigration

Today is a storm outside. It's been being here for whole day and I don't know when it stops. I did not a lot of things. Mostly I was working on cleaning my laptop's harddrive and installing updates. I updated ios and macos as well. I saw in apple presentation that now I shold have a possiblity to use iphones camera as web one, but it doesn't work. Probably it's something tricky here. As usualy it doesn't work from the box. It's bullshit. I really have waited this funcitnality, but it's apple it couldn't work fine. Also I've tried to do something with autocad licence for Ksusha. When I was reinstalling the application system was crushed. I've hardly found a way how it recover everying. Luckily I found a way and now it works fine. At the same time I had a plan to record a video today. Unfortunately I didn't do it because of hurricane and storm. It's interesting to see thunder in Noveber. Please understand me correctly, November is a winter month in Russia and it's impossible to see thinder in that time. Tomotrrow the new worling week will start. I will dive deep into coding again. It will be also cool if thunder will stop. But the way I had a greate call with Olger yesterday, with my mother today, and a few messages from Andrei Odintsov. He fled to Montenegro as he wanted to do. So, that is probably it for today.

# 07 November - Monday - Gündoğan - 39 day of immigration

What I did today:
1. Updated my survey solution to angular 14
2. Made a prototype of camera component
3. Walked a lot around my house.
4. The local photographer taken a photo for Green Card
5. Ksusha helped me and applyed for Green Card lottery
6. Did some maths and other things.
7. Learned management a bit. Unfortunately I didn't have enough time for it today.
8. I found an interesting youtube channel which helps with with writing skills. I will use it.

At the same time I feel that I am tiered of all this situation and want to go back home. It's so sad that I cannot do it. I wish all the worst to Putin. This fucking murderer and maniac shooted my life and ruined thousand of others ones. So, I still cannot stop think about it. I know that I will not forgive Putin and others fuckin morons that are near him.

# 08 November - Tuesday - Gündoğan - 40 day of immigration

Today I mostly was working on programming stuff. I'm really tiered due to early wake up.

1. I improved survey engine and added taken photo
2. I improved portuguese helper
3. I also wrote down some lines

Today I slept well, but not enough. I am trying to concentrate, but it's hard. Buy the way we finished watching secons season of Twin Peaks. Today I will start watching the third one. I really like this piece of art. Now i will go and eat some food.

# 09 November - Wednesday - Gündoğan - 41 day of immigration

One the most important things for me is to be in conscious state of mind. That's exictly why I practice meditation and try to be fit. I cannot say that I'm always in this mode. I try to work on it. About this day. I did a lot of product things today. I dived deeper into topic of idea quality understanding. At the same time I watche english language lessons. It's so cool to lear content for students despite the fact of my real age. But it's helpful for me, and as result it's enough for me. I also significantly improved layout for DRSMILE. Also there is one sad piece of news. On of the guys with whom I played music many years ago became a z-patriot. I know him. It's just because he thinks that it is right. It thinks that He will save russian culture using this approach. Francly, It's really painfull for me. I need to reflect it later. I hope he will go back alive.

# 10 November - Thursday - Gündoğan - 42 day of immigration

I've finally got a rhetoric course from DRSMILE. Chris by himself sent me a link to it. It's really cool becase as I understood our HRs lost a licence to udemy. It's absolute shit. Also I had a convesation with Sergey Dzeboyev, who is a backend developer. Georgia refused his application for Temporary residence. It's extrimely sad piece of news. Again, because of fuckin Putin we all have problems. At the same time I trained maths today, read a bit about maagement and had a nice day in general. It's about 30 munutes to the finish of my working day and I just trying to close all tasks. So, I need to record another video tomorrow. Time has come. It's a shame that I cannot do it for more that a week. At the same time I've got bad news. It's imposibble to ask for Digital Nomad within Portugal. I had to apply for this type of with outside of this country. Now It looks like I need to go to Croatia. This country has digital nomad with that is partially temporary residency stuff. I couldn't imagine that I had to do it. So, Again, thanks to fucking morons from kremlin. Hopefully, One day I will stop to hate them.

# 11 November - Friday - Gündoğan - 43 day of immigration

Today I've done with some imporovements for portuguese words helper. It's nice. I adde quiz supporting. Now I should work better. After that I got more cool information from the book about prduct maagement. I've got more information about how to structure new team or a company. Today is friday and I barely can remember all features that I done, but I remember one. I wrote new article for the medium. It's in English. I will sleep with it and check it tomorrow before publishing. Today I tolked a lot in english an I am absolutery tiered of it, I even sopped thinging normally in the end of the day. Now I am prepearing for moving for getting a dinner. it will in couple of minutes. So, from tomorrow I will start training my english prononciation. I will do it using microphone and texts from the book. Probably I will start reading on of them. It's really important. Tomorrow me and Ksusha re going to Turgutreis. She will paint nails while I will be in Starbacks. I need to became more open, It's why I place to record video in Enlgish despite the fact that it's really scary for me. I know that I just need to do it. But I have a topic for Russian blog and I will record it tomorrow. so. I think I will have an interesting news.

# 12 November - Saturday - Gündoğan - Turgutreis - Bodrum - 44 day of immigration

Today we had a cheatmeal! I like this day type. I eat a lot of junk food and I am happy. I got cookies, burger, coffee, and fahitas. It's georgious! I also recorded another video I'm going to edit it tomorrow. So, My plan for tomorrow is to publish new article to medium and edit the new video. I made 20000 steps today. I also starded moving all my telegram bo setup to typescript. It also good step. Me and Ksusha have written down timeline fo immigratin. It's also good. Now we have the plan that we will manage the next several months. Today the interesting thing happened. Turkey authorities sent a special earth quake message. It was a test and it was a new expierence for me. At the same time I see that I need to learn more english words and phrases. Maybe because of fatigue I speak english worse that before. I need to fix it. I get stuck on some patterns, like 'Also', 'At the same time', 'Hovewer', etc. It's bullshit. Nevermind, It's time to watch another episode of Twin Peaks. Let's go!

# 13 November - Sunday - Gündoğan - 45 day of immigration

Today is the 45th day of emigration. It's hard to realize. It's not so much, I agree. The massive exploision happened on Istiklal, which is the main tourist street in Istanbul. I saw a video with bodies. Ksusha helped me with editing new note that I'm going to pulish to Medium tomorrow. The vido #4 is also ready and prerendered. I will publish it tomorrow or the day after tomorrow. The whole first part of the day I spent of fixing problems with 3dmax and autocad. I did it for Ksusha. It's also very important because she cannot proceed studying without it. By the way, I had to start reading training tomorrow. It's very important for my English improvements. I've just understood that I have only one two months before interview process starting.

# 14 November - Monday - Gündoğan - 46 day of immigration

I published  a new article to medium today. I did it for imporving my english writing skill which I work on. I did meditation today and some sport. After that I trained my speaking skill by reading Orwell's essay about tea. It's one the most favourite piece of literature for me. My back is still hurt. I feel pain in my back mussles. I need to start doing yoga again. It should be something like toothbruching for me. Also I prepeared a video and uploaded it to youtube. The publication is going to tomorrow at 11 am. I did some maths and management learning today. In drsmile I had a nice budgeting platting meeting. It was cool and revieled a lot of things for me. I also asked for certification from DRSMILE people department. It contents an information about my relations with DRSMILE. Also my armenian accountant sent me two papers that I need to sign and send back. It's related to my IT certificate I assume. Also I recalled about my reactjs project. I need to incresae pripority of it. Strong knowlage of reatjs library is more important than Angular nowadays. Angular has problems with maintaining and popularity. Also I had a nice plannig meeting in DRSMILE. It will be fun to make all that stuff next week. Tomorrow I will have a lot interesting studying stuff. That is amazing. I like this type of mornings.

# 15 November - Tuesday - Gündoğan - 47 day of immigration

Today I did not some much, I trained english pronunciation again. I also got rhetoric lesson. I significantly improved drsmile's layout for surveys. The youtube video was published by me today's morning. The rest of the day was quite boring. Some unexpectible problems with water happened in the house. There is hot water and I cannot run washing machine because of no pressure in pipes. It's ridiculous and it hinders me. I think I will text to the apartments owner. I think he should be aware of the situation. I event cannot go to bathroom and take a shit, there is nothing to flush the shit. It's not good and ruins my mood. Anyway I hope the situation will be resolved soon.

# 16 November - Wednesday - Gündoğan - 48 day of immigration

Today I learned English and had product thinking lessons. I decided to cut number of maths lessons and switched to algorithms. It's more important thing now. Also changed a flow of protuguese workds learner helper. I removed timer and made sending of pictures by tapping to button. It is more effective. Then I want to create another several bots for different languages that I am interesing in. Now the flow is somthing like carouselle. It desn't have any authentification process. Also I train my english reading every day. I still focuse on my favourite Orwell Essay. It's about ideal cup of coffee. Another thing - yesterday I started investigation of other coutries. Maybe I will immigrate not to Portugal. I still don't know. But US salaries are significantly different. One thing - the householder payed for the water and now everything is ok. I've taken a shower and It's very cool. By the way, tomorrow morning I will have three cultural fit interview with potention future backend devs. It's really cool, because I usually don't do it. I mostly focused on technical ones. So, My working day practically finished and it's also cool, because I am really tiered of this day.

# 17 November - Tuesday - Gündoğan - 49 day of immigration

I had 2 interview and sevaral meeeting today. It was interesting and I found new things for me. Today morning I passes challenge about binary search. Yes, I returned to algorithm learning. I need to remember more before january. This time the new turn of job searchin will have been starting. I also feel not so well today. Something went wrong with blood pressure. It's hard to pay attention of things. I feel stoned a bit. I hate it. Some tremor in hands. Nevermind. I will be ok tomorrow probably. Also I fixed some issues in learning words bot. It is just side-project, but it's important. For DRSMILE I started developing of native camera support. There is some problems that I need to resolve somehow. For example, webcamera doesn't support vertical orientation. It's bad because customers shoul take photos by smartphones. Wow, one political thing is that yeserday's evening some pieces of rocket fell to Poland territory. I don't think that I was Russia. The most relevant thing is an opinion that these stuff are parts of Ukranian anti airplane protection.

# 18 November - Friday - Gündoğan - 50 day of immigration

Today I did a lot of things. I've presented the project in from of DRSMILE. It was internal project that are related to survey engine I am working on. I also had a lot of meetings. It was hard. but I had cool chat with Damian and Ryan. I also had a chat with Fedor about potential great changes in frontend stuff. I really need ti get budget for people. It's insane that I cannot hire more programmers. I don't need an army. I want to hire one. Newwermind. Me and Ksusha are thinking more about US. Maybe I will looking for a job there as well. Because of the war not only EU will my focus. I already started preparation for the future interviews. I think it will be ok. By the way I thought today about my inability to remebmer everything. Tommorow we are going to Bodrum for a walk. We will discuss our future plans. By the way in 3 weeks we will be in Yerevan. Armenia will be my temp house again.

# 19 November - Saturday - Gündoğan - Bodrum - 51 day of immigration

I am sitting in Bodurm now. I've started writing new article. This time I decided to use knowlage that I got from rhetoric lessons. It's a standard pattern of aultery. In the beginning I was young boy, then I became adult. The article is just abuout my life, not more. Ksusha is sitting near me and looking at reviews of Dyson fan. She wants to buy it. At the same time we decided not to go to Croatia. We will re residency in Armenia and maybe later will got futher. Now I need to focus on my future. I will be really hard to do everyrthing at the same time. I mean preparations for interview and resolving problems with citezenshit. Another great piece of news that Oleg is going to Yerevan next month. It means that we will have a chance to meet each other. Last time I saw him in Yerevean in the last spring. I've forgotten to add. Today we ordered airpods, douson fan, and case for my iphone. importnat thing. Todat I aslo don't feel good. Probably something went wron with blood pressure.

# 20 November - Sunday - Gündoğan - Yalikavak - 52 day of immigration

I am in Yalikavak now. It's not so ofter when I am writing these lines not from an apartment. os, Today is a free day. I walked a bit, studied rhetorics and did another nice things. The weather is not good and it's the reasong why I didn't record a new video. So, I cannot add a lot of lines. Because nothing happened today. It's just calm day witout events.

# 21 November - Sunday - Gündoğan - 53 day of immigration

Today I feel much better. Even I don't have hade acke. it's interesting how to write word "головная боль" correctly. I learned english today and dived into management topic. The other part of the day I was programming. I also listen to Tartak today. I try not to forget about reading alowd training. it's important. Also I improved words bot significantly. The main thing is to remove deps from some word's base. Now all languages, paths to data file are stored as parameters. It's extrimely convinient. Not I am going to have a dinner and then after coming back home we will watch the latest two episodes of Twin Peaks.

# 22 November - Monday - Gündoğan - 54 day of immigration

I was working  on DRS tasks mostly today. But I fortunately found some time for algorithms and other important things. I also found several books that I need to read. They are about rhetorics and achitypes.

1. I faced to Android issue again. Firebase and target versions dont's work.
2. Gathered information about CTO interview
3. Wrote a code
4. Had a long call with Narayan
5. Learned Portuguese.
Unfortunately I slept bad today. Because of it I feel no good. I hate moscitous. Mosquitoes prevent me from sleeping. from another side I still cannot start learning important phrases in Englihs. Probably because I am lazy. I need to focus. I need to be better. I need to finish all stuff and do great things. Tomorrow I will code for whole day. I also have only thirsday for finishing some coding. I am going to run another telegram bot for learning english phazes.

# 23 November - Tuesday - Gündoğan - Bodrum - 55 day of immigration

I've rcorded another video today. Unfortunately it's bad weather today and local internet doesn't work well. It's why I couldn't edit the video and publish it. At the same time I did a lot of code for DR SMILE today. I improved layout and some another things. Media markt send a message today that our order is ready. We went to Bodrum today and got it. Ksusha bought new fan from Dyson. I bought airpods pro and new case for Iphone. Due to tax free program we cannot open boxes now. Refund is really big and It will be better to get that money. It's not a problem because we will be in Armenia very soon. In the morning I learned English and tryed to pass unit test. It was unsuccessful. One thing that make me happy is that I do everything that is planned every day. I've built a habit that helps me to be consistent. It's something new for me. Usually I have problem with making things in time and order. Due to problems with interned I didn't find a new series for the evening. The black friday has been started and me with Ksusha ordered some new clothes on asos. I hope it will be in Armenia when we will be there. Previouse we didn't recieve an order and got refund. It's cool tha asos so good in customer support. I wish Drsmle has the same. It's needed to mention that I am happy that I got the chance to work for DRSMILE. It's not because I am so teammy guy, but because I can see how business works. It gives me a chance to reproduce similar things withing my own business or in future working place.

# 24 November - Thursday - Gündoğan - 56 day of immigration

I woke up about na hour ago. The internet doesn't work. Another sad thing that we bought an additional internet package yesterday. It's nor clear but I wasn't applied and doesnt work now. It's very nervous when your job depends on an internet connection and you don't have it. I believe that I need to go to the city center and try to resolve in turkcell office which is my mobile operator. Also I think that i might be not only problem with turkcell but also with internet repeater in my apartment. It reloads constatly and don't know if it's normal behavour. It looks like an issue. Honestly I didn't expect that I will have so many problems with internet here. the place looks like very touristik and everything should work properly. I hate it. The problem was fixedm but we already bought additional internet package. now I am almost finished with tasks for today. I had sevaral calls about forntend topics. I also practically shaped new telegram bot, but for learning english workds. I prepared some scrips that help we in data parsing. Data - collectin of words. The bad thing of this day is that I didn't learn anything. It was because I was fixing problem of internet for whole morning.

# 25 November - Friday - Gündoğan - 57 day of immigration

Today I finished with integration on DR SMiLE side. It's great. I feel relief. Also I improved the bot for enlish learning. Several workds about my personal life. I am tiered of this place. definetly it's a village. I need more activities. It's pretty calm place and thats great, but boring. In one week and half I will be in Istanbul and this is good. The next stop is Yerevan, that is also great. It's pretty cold there, but more fun. I also found a lot of interesting websited for CTOs. I am going to be this guy and I need to pump or upgrade myself in this way. It's so boring to be just a programmer. i need more, much more. Surely, firstly I need to improve my speaking and writing skills. basically it's an endless process. But i got a lot of new information about what I do and why. that's awesome. tomotrrow we are going to Bodrum. I want to get a haircut and me with Ksusha will discuss CTO things. Also I need to edit my new video that i recorded this week. It's exactly about diaries and couple words about audiodieary or pppodcast.

# 26 November - Saturday - Gündoğan - Bodrum - 58 day of immigration

Today I got a haircut in Bodrum. It's good. Me and Ksusha had a discussion about CTO, we have a draft from my future steps for uptaining this role. I also had a nice conversation with colleegs in linkedin. I really think a lot about my personal brand. This way is the most iteresting for me. it's very hight bar that I want to achive. I don't have a lot of words and ideas. Tomorrow I am going to preapre another video. Recodding of videos are fun.

# 27 November - Sunday - Gündoğan - Bodrum - 59 day of immigration

It's really cold today. I've decided to try typefully application today. I scheduled the firt tweet. (several hours later). This sevice is a shit. They want 8 bucks per month for shcduling more that one tweet. It's useless. we went ot Bodrum in order to find new jacket. So, we found one for me. Ksusha ordeded another one for her on the internet. Probably we will got to Turgutreis in order to get this thing. Now I am sitting in local library in Bodrum. I finally fixed problem with Telegram bot for learning words. I am happy that I did it. Sometimes I can use it. I still don't have time for finishing all business that I planned. It's sad. I also have a huge list of things tha I need to finish today. Today's is a mother's day. I texted to my mom some good words. I miss her. It would be so cool to see her and just talk. I need to call to my aunt as well and organiza whatsapp call with my grandmother. I miss them all. It's really hard to live and understand that I will not see them for a very long time. My desire to be alive is stronger.

# 28 November - Monday - Gündoğan - 60 day of immigration

Today is mostly orgaizational day. I did a lot of manegerial tasks. Tomorrow I will start with coding again. also I want to groom my current project and got some insights. I did a lot of stuff for the last year and it's a good time to underline it. Unfortunately I don't have time for everything that I want to do. I am not a magician. I fon something in the twitter. It's very strange, because I even don't remember what I exactly will get. I've sent my email address, probably someone will text to me. 

Also I started linkein thext grooming and investigation of how to change my cv and make it more attractive for CTO position.

Yesterday I bought a jacket and this is good, because the wherther today is aweful. I went to a shop this morning and this thing was very usefull. It's just rains for whole days.

I again forget and editing the latest blog. I will add this to my todolist. It's the only way to remember about it.

In the end: this day is good.

# 29 November - Tuesday - Gündoğan - 61 day of immigration

Today I have bad mood. I even argued with IT team because they still cannot update workflow in jira for me. Also I fixed issue with the mobile application. I trained a bit algorythm, rhetorics, and another thigns. I even started editing of new video. Tomorrow I am going to finish with it. I am already tiered of this place where I live. I am happy that I will leave the place in one week. Istanbul has been waiting for me.
