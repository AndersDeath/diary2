# 01 November - Tuesday - Gündoğan - 33 day of immigration

I decided to count immigration days a month ago. I think it's important to remember the time of the new life. I consider that my previouse life has been end. And not only my life, but many people from Russia, Belarus and Ukrain had to change everything. The couse is obviouse - the war. I will call it the war despite the fact that it's prohibited in Russia. I also remembered that yesterday Ksusha found chamelion on roof terrace. It's so an interesting animal. It catched a chair and put it near a tree and chamelion moved to the tree this morning. Also I learned portuguese today and code a lot. When I was going to the shop I recorded another video about immigration. I will process itg and upload to youtube in the next morning. I'm very tiered today. It's really hard day. I woke up too early in the morning and didn't rest enough. I will go to sleep in time today.

# 02 November - Wednesday - Gündoğan - 34 day of immigration

Today I was working mostly on educatin and programming stuff. I finished with a lot of things. I woke up in time and immidiently started learing things. Also I published third video on my youtube channgel. I was speaking about internal immigration. I like to record videos it's just fun. I am trying to make myself better evey day. Luckily today I feel better than yesterday. I slept well. By the way I found photo studio which can take photos for green card lottery. It's very good. Tomorrow we are going to that place and after that we are going to fill the statement. I still have a hope to win that lottery. Sometimes I think a lot about immigation to USA. That country is not ideal, but I looks pretty predictable and understandable. It's about 17.00 o'clock. I am quite tiered and honestly really want to have a rest. We bought some local meatballs that I want to cook after a meeting where I am hanging now. It's Treatment expierence meeting. Tomorrow byt the wat I will finish with survey bullshit and just after that I will start working on photo shooting mechanism. It will be really interesting. I am also extriemly exited about boat trip that will be next saturday. It's a part of my old deam about becaming a yaht capitan. Other than that I've just recalled about getting apartments in Yerevan for three months in total and for 10 day in Tbilisi. So, In general I am satisfied by myself, because every day I do something that move me closer to my main goal. I want to be rich and smart at the same time.

# 03 November - Thursday - Gündoğan - 35 day of immigration

I made a small bot helper which will help me with prtuguese learning. The clue is that this bot sends words every 5 minutes. I can just read messages and repeat words. also I finished with validation of required fields in survey engine. Tommorow is the public holiday in Russia. We are going to walk in another city that is near ours one. I also trained math and management today. TOday I feel that I am tiered. It's interesting that I don't know what to write, because not so many events happened. Honestly it's cool. I thing that makes me calm. The only thing that worries me now. I don't have cool and comfortable chair. It will be the first thing that I will buy after getting home.

# 04 November - Thursday - Gündoğan - GÜMÜŞLÜK - 36 day of immigration

We visited gumusluk today. It's a small town in 30 minutes from home. We spent about 2 hours there and then came back to gundogan. Today I've built workable version of my telegram bot that can help me to remember portuguese words. I prepeared a image generator and now the bot sends not just strings but images with a word and a translation. It looks better as well. Tomorrow we are going to trip on a boat in turgutreis.
