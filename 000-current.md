# 01 November - Tuesday - Gündoğan - 33 day of immigration

I decided to count immigration days a month ago. I think it's important to remember the time of the new life. I consider that my previouse life has been end. And not only my life, but many people from Russia, Belarus and Ukrain had to change everything. The couse is obviouse - the war. I will call it the war despite the fact that it's prohibited in Russia. I also remembered that yesterday Ksusha found chamelion on roof terrace. It's so an interesting animal. It catched a chair and put it near a tree and chamelion moved to the tree this morning. Also I learned portuguese today and code a lot. When I was going to the shop I recorded another video about immigration. I will process itg and upload to youtube in the next morning. I'm very tiered today. It's really hard day. I woke up too early in the morning and didn't rest enough. I will go to sleep in time today.
