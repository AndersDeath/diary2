# 01 May - Monday - Barcelona - 214 day of immigration

Today we were in the park that was in Parfumer movie. There is a labyrinth there. It's quite nice place and I was surprised. we also were at plau de la musica which is one of the first modernizm buildings in Barcelona. The rest of the day we spent at home. I also definitely have to proceed with sport and meditation. I also was coding with pleasure today. It's quite rare situation. I also finally finished with Holy Theory metadata adding. It's cool. The documentation for holy theory generator is also finished. It will be a short and simple javascript program which helps to prepare data for eleventy and just simple readme file. I will come back to walking. I went to Barcelona's beach and had a nice time there. Ksusha stayed at home and I was there alone. Anyway it was a pleasure. I was listening to techno and other music.

This day was a good. We didn't walk a lot and I am not so tiered. I can say the same about Ksusha.
