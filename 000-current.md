# 01 November - Tuesday - Gündoğan - 33 day of immigration

I decided to count immigration days a month ago. I think it's important to remember the time of the new life. I consider that my previouse life has been end. And not only my life, but many people from Russia, Belarus and Ukrain had to change everything. The couse is obviouse - the war. I will call it the war despite the fact that it's prohibited in Russia. I also remembered that yesterday Ksusha found chamelion on roof terrace. It's so an interesting animal. It catched a chair and put it near a tree and chamelion moved to the tree this morning. Also I learned portuguese today and code a lot. When I was going to the shop I recorded another video about immigration. I will process itg and upload to youtube in the next morning. I'm very tiered today. It's really hard day. I woke up too early in the morning and didn't rest enough. I will go to sleep in time today.

# 02 November - Wednesday - Gündoğan - 34 day of immigration

Today I was working mostly on educatin and programming stuff. I finished with a lot of things. I woke up in time and immidiently started learing things. Also I published third video on my youtube channgel. I was speaking about internal immigration. I like to record videos it's just fun. I am trying to make myself better evey day. Luckily today I feel better than yesterday. I slept well. By the way I found photo studio which can take photos for green card lottery. It's very good. Tomorrow we are going to that place and after that we are going to fill the statement. I still have a hope to win that lottery. Sometimes I think a lot about immigation to USA. That country is not ideal, but I looks pretty predictable and understandable. It's about 17.00 o'clock. I am quite tiered and honestly really want to have a rest. We bought some local meatballs that I want to cook after a meeting where I am hanging now. It's Treatment expierence meeting. Tomorrow byt the wat I will finish with survey bullshit and just after that I will start working on photo shooting mechanism. It will be really interesting. I am also extriemly exited about boat trip that will be next saturday. It's a part of my old deam about becaming a yaht capitan. Other than that I've just recalled about getting apartments in Yerevan for three months in total and for 10 day in Tbilisi. So, In general I am satisfied by myself, because every day I do something that move me closer to my main goal. I want to be rich and smart at the same time.

# 03 November - Thursday - Gündoğan - 35 day of immigration

I made a small bot helper which will help me with prtuguese learning. The clue is that this bot sends words every 5 minutes. I can just read messages and repeat words. also I finished with validation of required fields in survey engine. Tommorow is the public holiday in Russia. We are going to walk in another city that is near ours one. I also trained math and management today. TOday I feel that I am tiered. It's interesting that I don't know what to write, because not so many events happened. Honestly it's cool. I thing that makes me calm. The only thing that worries me now. I don't have cool and comfortable chair. It will be the first thing that I will buy after getting home.

# 04 November - Firday - Gündoğan - GÜMÜŞLÜK - 36 day of immigration

We visited gumusluk today. It's a small town in 30 minutes from home. We spent about 2 hours there and then came back to gundogan. Today I've built workable version of my telegram bot that can help me to remember portuguese words. I prepeared a image generator and now the bot sends not just strings but images with a word and a translation. It looks better as well. Tomorrow we are going to trip on a boat in turgutreis. I realy exatied about it. Unfortunately it means that I need to weak up erlier than I usually do in on saturdays. But it's the only way. If you think about other business then I did nothing today. At the same time I eat a beautiful desert in gumusluk. Also It was last time when I visited that place. It's really nothing to do in this place. So. Now I will go to prepare myself to sleep. Thank you.

# 05 November - Saturday - Gündoğan - Turgutreis - 37 day of immigration

Yesterday I imporove bot assistend which will help me with learning Portuguese language. it's really nice. So, Today we ride a yaht. It was airbnb expierence. It was the first time when we bought it. Kapitan was very nice person. Luckly he knows english very well and we didn't have communication problems with him. We rent it for 3 hour but in fact our trip was about 4 ones. It's really cool. We discussed politics, economy, and how to drive yaht. I even tried to rule it. In the middle of the trip capitan Rizo cooked a lunch for us. It was simple.but cool. I rally want to buy this kind of boat to ,yself. It looks like a dream.

I also had a long call with Oleg today. We discussed visa quesiton and our lives in general. he is a smart guy, but sometimes I see how it's hard for him to analyze the situation. It's a part of his personality. I know him gor a whole life and our friendshipt matters a lot for me. I wish him all the best. He is like a brother for me. honestly I miss him very much.

Yesterday there was a earthquake in Izmir. Today Is the same near Rodos island that is very close to me. It's fun but I feel how our house is shaking a bit. Firstly I thought that I just drunk to much wine today on the boat, but it's not. It's the first time in my life when i feel earthquake things. Far enough, now I will go to watch a series. 

# 06 November - Sunday - Gündoğan - 38 day of immigration

Today is a storm outside. It's been being here for whole day and I don't know when it stops. I did not a lot of things. Mostly I was working on cleaning my laptop's harddrive and installing updates. I updated ios and macos as well. I saw in apple presentation that now I shold have a possiblity to use iphones camera as web one, but it doesn't work. Probably it's something tricky here. As usualy it doesn't work from the box. It's bullshit. I really have waited this funcitnality, but it's apple it couldn't work fine. Also I've tried to do something with autocad licence for Ksusha. When I was reinstalling the application system was crushed. I've hardly found a way how it recover everying. Luckily I found a way and now it works fine. At the same time I had a plan to record a video today. Unfortunately I didn't do it because of hurricane and storm. It's interesting to see thunder in Noveber. Please understand me correctly, November is a winter month in Russia and it's impossible to see thinder in that time. Tomotrrow the new worling week will start. I will dive deep into coding again. It will be also cool if thunder will stop. But the way I had a greate call with Olger yesterday, with my mother today, and a few messages from Andrei Odintsov. He fled to Montenegro as he wanted to do. So, that is probably it for today.

# 07 November - Monday - Gündoğan - 39 day of immigration

What I did today:
1. Updated my survey solution to angular 14
2. Made a prototype of camera component

6. Did some maths and other things.
7. Learned management a bit. Unfortunately I didn't have enough time for it today.
8. I found an interesting youtube channel which helps with with writing skills. I will use it.

At the same time I feel that I am tiered of all this situation and want to go back home. It's so sad that I cannot do it. I wish all the worst to Putin. This fucking murderer and maniac shooted my life and ruined thousand of others ones. So, I still cannot stop think about it. I know that I will not forgive Putin and others fuckin morons that are near him.

# 09 November - Wednesday - Gündoğan - 41 day of immigration

One the most important things for me is to be in conscious state of mind. That's exictly why I practice meditation and try to be fit. I cannot say that I'm always in this mode. I try to work on it. About this day. I did a lot of product things today. I dived deeper into topic of idea quality understanding. At the same time I watche english language lessons. It's so cool to lear content for students despite the fact of my real age. But it's helpful for me, and as result it's enough for me. I also significantly improved layout for DRSMILE. Also there is one sad piece of news. On of the guys with whom I played music many years ago became a z-patriot. I know him. It's just because he thinks that it is right. It thinks that He will save russian culture using this approach. Francly, It's really painfull for me. I need to reflect it later. I hope he will go back alive.

# 10 November - Thursday - Gündoğan - 42 day of immigration

I've finally got a rhetoric course from DRSMILE. Chris by himself sent me a link to it. It's really cool becase as I understood our HRs lost a licence to udemy. It's absolute shit. Also I had a convesation with Sergey Dzeboyev, who is a backend developer. Georgia refused his application for Temporary residence. It's extrimely sad piece of news. Again, because of fuckin Putin we all have problems. At the same time I trained maths today, read a bit about maagement and had a nice day in general. It's about 30 munutes to the finish of my working day and I just trying to close all tasks. So, I need to record another video tomorrow. Time has come. It's a shame that I cannot do it for more that a week. At the same time I've got bad news. It's imposibble to ask for Digital Nomad within Portugal. I had to apply for this type of with outside of this country. Now It looks like I need to go to Croatia. This country has digital nomad with that is partially temporary residency stuff. I couldn't imagine that I had to do it. So, Again, thanks to fucking morons from kremlin. Hopefully, One day I will stop to hate them.

# 11 November - Friday - Gündoğan - 43 day of immigration

Today I've done with some imporovements for portuguese words helper. It's nice. I adde quiz supporting. Now I should work better. After that I got more cool information from the book about prduct maagement. I've got more information about how to structure new team or a company. Today is friday and I barely can remember all features that I done, but I remember one. I wrote new article for the medium. It's in English. I will sleep with it and check it tomorrow before publishing. Today I tolked a lot in english an I am absolutery tiered of it, I even sopped thinging normally in the end of the day. Now I am prepearing for moving for getting a dinner. it will in couple of minutes. So, from tomorrow I will start training my english prononciation. I will do it using microphone and texts from the book. Probably I will start reading on of them. It's really important. Tomorrow me and Ksusha re going to Turgutreis. She will paint nails while I will be in Starbacks. I need to became more open, It's why I place to record video in Enlgish despite the fact that it's really scary for me. I know that I just need to do it. But I have a topic for Russian blog and I will record it tomorrow. so. I think I will have an interesting news.

# 12 November - Saturday - Gündoğan - Turgutreis - Bodrum - 44 day of immigration

Today we had a cheatmeal! I like this day type. I eat a lot of junk food and I am happy. I got cookies, burger, coffee, and fahitas. It's georgious! I also recorded another video I'm going to edit it tomorrow. So, My plan for tomorrow is to publish new article to medium and edit the new video. I made 20000 steps today. I also starded moving all my telegram bo setup to typescript. It also good step. Me and Ksusha have written down timeline fo immigratin. It's also good. Now we have the plan that we will manage the next several months. Today the interesting thing happened. Turkey authorities sent a special earth quake message. It was a test and it was a new expierence for me. At the same time I see that I need to learn more english words and phrases. Maybe because of fatigue I speak english worse that before. I need to fix it. I get stuck on some patterns, like 'Also', 'At the same time', 'Hovewer', etc. It's bullshit. Nevermind, It's time to watch another episode of Twin Peaks. Let's go!

# 13 November - Sunday - Gündoğan - 45 day of immigration

Today is the 45th day of emigration. It's hard to realize. It's not so much, I agree. The massive exploision happened on Istiklal, which is the main tourist street in Istanbul. I saw a video with bodies. Ksusha helped me with editing new note that I'm going to pulish to Medium tomorrow. The vido #4 is also ready and prerendered. I will publish it tomorrow or the day after tomorrow. The whole first part of the day I spent of fixing problems with 3dmax and autocad. I did it for Ksusha.
