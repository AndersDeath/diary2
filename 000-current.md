# 01 November - Wednesday - Yerevan - 398 day of immigration

Today I was working on entities for my nx setup. It was interesting and nice. I'm going to finish working on it. BRsided that I was learning German and doing other things. I pissed off of dR SMILE. These morons didn't send money to me again. It makes me really angry. I really want to finish working for them as soon as possible. I pissed off. Also I found how to reach out railway station in Dortmund. It will be easier than I expect because this place has shuttle bus from airport to railway station. It's really nice and not so expensive. Just 10 euros and I am there. In general my vacation goes smooth. I have time to work on many things I spend this time smart. Also me and Ksusha were in cafe today. We got lunch and worked from that place. In couple of minutes we will go to the cinema. Yep, Vacation goes well. I like it.

# 02 November - Thursday - Yerevan - 399 day of immigration

I feel very angry for an unknown reasons. It's been happening since yesterday. It's really simple for me to go out of temper. I don't like it but cannot do anything with it. It's just needed to be mentioned. Also we were in the cinema yesterday in the evening. we watched Killers of the Flower Moon. It's a movie about white americans that were ready for everything for getting oil fields from native americans. It's really powerful picture. I highly recommend to look at it. Today I was doing usual things according my daily plan.Additionally I build a special version of telegram bot that helps me in learning of german words. It was important thing. Also I visited my Podologist, maybe last time. I am not sure that I will got to get at 14 of November. Probably I will just cancel this schedule. Tomorrow I will proceed working on my usual things.

# 03 November - Friday - Yerevan - 400 day of immigration

Oh, 400th day of my immigration. It's interesting. 400 days ago I understood that the war will not end and I have to leave the country. Before that I considered Yerevan as a temporary place for work and waiting for collapse of Russian army, but the war is still here. Also Palestine and Israel are fighting to each other. It's absolutely scary situation. I feel like the world got crazy. But let's go back to me. I did a lot of things today. I woke up early in the morning. I was editing the barcelona video, added some updated to holy theory, and was working on other things. Unfortunately at least the half of my vacation ended. It's sad. Other this is that in two week we will be in Germany. It's crazy. I still cannot believe in it. I will be a complete immigrant. It's so crazy. I don't understand if it's good or bad. It's something new. I am excited and scared at the same time. The completely new life will start for me and Ksusha. It's crazy. I realized that I cannot feel it normally. Some weird emotions come to me.

# 04 November - Saturday - Yerevan - 401 day of immigration

THis day was nice. Ksusha did a surgery today. She decided to fix a shape of one of her ears. Fo some reasons she didn't like it. I visited my dentist today and she assured me that everything is ok with my teeth for now. It's good. She also sent me a contact of one woman that lives in Germany and she is dentist as well. Unfortunately she lives in one hour by train. Knowing that Europe is so small I don't afraid of it. So, Now I am going to order a dinner and then I will go for a walk. Ksusha cannot go anyplace because of the bandage on the ear. So, today I will walk alone. Also I need to edit Barcelona video today probably. I will do it right after finishing writing this note. It's so crazy that I keep writing this diary. It's so interesting. I didn't calculate days that were described here but I do it since april 2022. I started doing it after the beginning of the war just for therapy and I can say that it works. I feel much better. The fact that I can describe everything fairly makes me happy. Maybe someone will read these lines. It would be fun. Also it's interesting if i generate a pdf file with all these notes how much pages will it be? One day I will try to do it.

# 05 November - Sunday - Yerevan - 402 day of immigration

The main thing for today is that I decided to stop the run for commit numbers to github. I realized recently that I make about 50 commits daily with no sense. Simply I do a lot of absolute weird things for no reason. So, I want to keep solid streak in gh but I don't want to have thousands commits yearly. It's just stupid. In general this day was nice. We went for a walk with Ksusha for some long period of time and visited a couple of nice places. She feels good but the ear still pains. It hope that the recovery process will be fine and everything is good soon. Additionally I prepared a plan for tuesday's meetings with people about my leaving of the company. It's good to have a schema of conversation. I like it very much. Another weird thing is that we will be in Berlin in 11 days. Crazy. Also I finished Barcelona video. I will prepare everything for publishing tomorrow and it will appear on my youtube channel finally. Also I want to record another video tomorrow. It will be long shoot about my current situation. It will be a real diary I suppose. I am going to visit surgeon tomorrow and right after this I will record a video. it's cool because I will have at least a week and a half for editing and publishing it. After that I will record another one in Berlin. So, yes. Staying in Yerevan is about to finish.

# 06 November - Monday - Yerevan - 403 day of immigration

Today my dentist removed stitches and I am happy about it. I can return my sport activities tomorrow. I am also happy about it. Fortunately the next surgery will be in several months which is amazing. surely I need to restore my smile but I am so tiered of it. The main thing for today is that I finished with damn Barcelona video. It's done. It's so cool people, you cannot imagine how I am happy about it. Tomorrow I will record another video. The thing is that I will say to my colleges about my leaving tomorrow and in this video I will tell about it to everybody else. It's cool. However my main focus now is to finish the article. I decided to focus on it. It will be cool. I was talking to my mother and I got bad news about one person from their circle. He was found dead in the bus recently. Nobody knows what is the reason of his death. Probably it's alcoholism. From other sides the day was nice. Tomorrow will be even better.

# 07 November - Tuesday - Yerevan - 404 day of immigration

I finally informed DR SMILE about my leaving. Everybody got this piece of news well. It wasn't a surprise for anyone. So, my motivation package will be payed to me in March probably.
