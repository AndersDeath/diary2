# 01 April - Montag - Berlin - 559 Tag der Einwanderung - Cold Sunny

I hate day of fool. It's always a piece of shit. However nobody pranked me and I am happy about it. At the same time I did a lot of cool things during the day. I learned some stuff and released another version of Holy Theory. On bad thing happened to me. It looks like my haemorrhoids came back to me. I need to have some relief but I don't know how. The situation is dangerous again.

The same weather like yesterday. I feel worse today. We even got a couple of new termins to doctors. I hope to visit them on the next week. I hope to see them really. It looks like I am very close to surgery again. WIll see. I try to get some specific pills that can help me. I need to be on diet now that is sad but important to me. Besides that I did a lot of good things again. I was coding and did some investigation things. To be honest my illness pushed my mood down again. It's painful really. At the same time I still have an illusion that medications will help me.

The day was nice. Nothing fency happened. I still don't feel good. However I did a lot of good things and it's really cool. The day after tomorrow I will go to a doctor and get something him. I hope that my insurance will cover the visit. I really hope. I don't have money for this now. I think everything will be ok. I also have a termin to proctologist and it's  good.

Today I also feel ok. Surely I cannot postpone the visit to doctor. It's cool that I am going to him tomorrow morning. I found all papers I received last time when I had surgery. I am sure that It will help me tomorrow. I also need to be in schedule again. I am not so motivated to work in XU. The stopping working with the Polish team hit me very much. I could not expect this. Currently I need to change my behavior's strategy. Besides that I just was in the bed for a hole day. I could do much due to pain. I drink pills and other medication but for me even sitting is uncomfortable now. I hate this illness. Vein system is my weak point. After treatment that I suppose to get tomorrow I will do much more sport. I really don't want to have this again. It's so bad.

I was in the doctor office today. He gave me a paper for proctologist quite easy and quickly. Here in Germany it's impossible going to such doctors without approval from a therapist. So yea. I got everything nad it's nice. The bad think that a termin to tsurgeon is in 10 day. I need to wait for it and eat medications. It's sad because I don't want to destroy my liver and kidneys. But I have no choise. Additionally I was in Barbershop and a woman did haircut fom me. I think that I didn't do haircut by barber-woman for the last 5 years I believe. This barberin did hair very well. Tomorrow we are going to meet Gammel family that is really cool. So, in general the day was nice.

# 06 April - Samstag - Berlin - 564 Tag der Einwanderung - Warm Sunny

The day ws nice. We were in Garder of the World in Eastern Berlin. We walked there with Gammel family and they showed us this place. It's a really cool garden with themed to different cultures corners. We were walking, talking, having fun. After that we ate in Ikea and visited Uniqlo because I needed to buy some stuff there. Also I payed for CT finally and exchanged 300 dollars we had as a reserve. It's was nice. We were so tired that the only thing we could do at home - sleep. In genera the day was really nice. I enjoyed it very much. I would like to repeat this.

# 07 April - Sontag - Berlin - 565 Tag der Einwanderung - Warm Sunny

Today we finally cleaned up our aoartments and did some other typicall activities. The summer came to Berlin, the weather is so cool. We had a lunch on outside table in one of local restaraunts. It's was really nice. Warm Berlin is really cool and enjoyable. I like it very very much. Surely the fact that we came to the place in the middle of the Winter played its bad role. We wasn't happy of the place, but now everything feels much better. Another thing is that I had a German lesson this morning. It sucks that I need to memorize a lot of things. I don't like it at all, but I need to have b1 certificate for getting permanent residency. It's my real plan that I need to accomplish somehow. I will do my best for it.
