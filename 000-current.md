# 01 Juli - Montag - Paris - 648 Tag der Einwanderung - Cool Rainy

Today I was working in the first part of the days and was walking alone in the second one. Alina and Ksusha went to Disnay land without me. It was cool because I really wanted to walk alone. I was on Monparnas and just walked in the city center, took photos, looked at libraries and universities. That places are very pwerful for me. I like to be there. I was alone for a whole day and was thinking a lot about my life. I am ready for recharging doing cool things again. I feel much better. I needed to have such trip. It's cool to be with money and live in Europe with local documents. Also I got an idea that Paris in what Saint-Peterburg wanted to be. It's just strange but something like this.

# 02 Juli - Dienstag - Paris - Berlin - 649 Tag der Einwanderung - Cool Rainy

Today we sad good buy to Alina in the morning and then went to Orly airport. I need to say that place is not so good as I expected. Surely it's another big international airport and so on, but the place is quite badly organized. After checkin and passing control we had to find an internal bus that moved us to real barn on the edge of airport. It was quite stupid. Also french people are not so friendly like germans usually are. Besides that they don't duplicate anouncements in egnlish. It was quite annoing. After arriving to Berlin we came home smoothly and without any problems. It was nice. We had a little rest and were ok.

# 03 Juli - Mittwoch - Berlin - 650 Tag der Einwanderung - Cool Rainy

I had to miss Toastmasters today because I didn't feel well. The flight made me so tiered. I in general don't feel so good for having all those additional activities I planned before. Howerver I try to do my best for being ok.I know that I am moaning again but it's my diary and it supposes to have such notes as well. IN general day was nice. I did my job and having rest.

# 04 Juli - Donnerstag - Berlin - 651 Tag der Einwanderung - Warm Clear sky

This morning I checked my eyes in some weird clinic. I experted to have some normal checkup but in face I just experiences some strange stuff. Surely they checked my eyes but if face they didn't offer me to have anything. I cannot get glasses or something like this. It was just waste of time and useless. Also I am conitueing to fight with XU for documents. They answer so slow and it annoys me a lot. In general I face with such behaviour every time in Germany. They are not organized at all. They have so many rules that they follow but if something happens out of them, Germans do nothing. It makes me mad. So stupid. However I need to learn their language that I did today again. Step by step I dive deeper and deepers to it. It's really cool.

# 05 Juli - Freitag - Berlin - 652 Tag der Einwanderung - Warm Clear sky

I recieved all final papers from XU and also was fucked a little by. They desided that I should not have birthday certificat because I left company. It was so stupid because at that moment I was a employee. It is unfair and speaks a lot about them. I am preparing an plan agains them that I will do definetly. Besides review on some websited I also plan contacting to ex coleeges and say some words about them. It's my intention. I will do what I need to do. It will be fair as well. Besided that nothing really interesting happened today. Life goes and I struggel with it.

# 06 Juli - Samstag - Berlin - 653 Tag der Einwanderung - Warm Clear sky

We wanted to visit a botanic garden but cancelled it due to lazyness. The good thing that I finally bought some skateboarding protection that allows me to stard using my skateboard. The probles is time. I need time for it. So, yes we were walking for a whole day and everything was really nice. It was cool calm saturday that I missed so much. It was nice.

# 07 Juli - Sonntag - Berlin - 654 Tag der Einwanderung - Warm Clear sky

It's hard to find so useless day in this uneverce. we were walking and sitting at home. Not more. I literally did nothing today. Usually it is quite rare situation but this is a fact. I did nothing.

# 08 Juli - Montag - Berlin - 655 Tag der Einwanderung - Warm Rainy

This monday is really important. I finally slpit my Holy Theory project to two parts. The first one is a piece of software for building books and another one is about wiritng a book itself. I thought about it for a really long time. The biggest consern that I had was impossibility of publishubg software and text under the same licence. In fact If I want to protect what I do I must split them and select proper licences for them. I decided to use gpl2 for soft and some other for text. I am going to change versioning approach as well. It's important thing in general. So yes. It is a new step of my projct. I am really exited to having something new. I need to pick a name for software, theoretical articles will be Holy Theory like it was planned initially. Besides that I was in the office today and did a lot of interesting things.

# 09 Juli - Dienstag - Berlin - 656 Tag der Einwanderung - Warm Rainy

I selected new name for the project, I will be called flexographer. It is a little bit long but I don't care. It's is a name for the soft, not for a product. The weather in Berling quite shitty. Rains are really heavy and try to wash everybody away. This is crazy. But it is what it is. I still don't have time to start writing a rewive to XU company. I need to plan it finally. Also I decided to stop using DUOLINGO at all. I was using it for 455 days in a row which was crazy and addicitve. I am happy to get rid of it.

# 10 Juli - Mittwoch - Berlin - 657 Tag der Einwanderung - Warm Rainy

The office day was nice and rainy a litte bit. In the evening I was on Toastmasters meeting and It was absolutely disaster. First of all I was aextremely tiered and the place where we were was extremely heat. I could not brethe almost. Crazy. Because of it I left the meeting in the middle of it and the heavy rain cought me. I was so bad that I had to move my passport to the pants pocket because my backpack literally was watered. It was crazy.

# 11 Juli - Donnerstag - Berlin - 658 Tag der Einwanderung - Warm Rainy

I was at home toaday. I like such days. Office is a good thing is some respect but destroying. Every time I struggle because of something there. However I had a nice day at home and did nothing. I like such days so much. Some cool things were delivered at home and it was also cool.

# 12 Juli - Freitag - Berlin - 659 Tag der Einwanderung - Warm Rainy

Today we were in the cinema and whatched a movide in english. I don't remember a name of it but it was a light film about Chennig tatum and how he was participating in Apllo program. It was really fun. But the funniest thing that made day was a karaoke box with 4 girls inside that were signing Руки Вверх band song. Karaoke box is a cabin, that looks like street toulet or photo box where you can close youself, pay some money and sing a song. The reall fun thing that I could not expect such stuff with such song on Uber platz in the middle of Berlin. It's crazy.

# 13 Juli - Samstag - Berlin - 660 Tag der Einwanderung - Warm Sunny

One of the main principles for me on this stage of my life is to have a good rest. Today I did nothing. It was really good. I can highly recommend it to others. I will do it again and againg in my life.

# 14 Juli - Sonnstag - Berlin - 661 Tag der Einwanderung - Warm Sunny

We finally were in Botanic garden. It is nice place but it's not so atmospheric I would say. If you ask me to rate all botanic gardens I were inside I would place Yerevan's one to the first place, Saint-Petersburg's one to the second, and the Berlin's Botanic garthe I place to third. It was nice but not so phantastic or atmospheric. Yea. But I am really glad to visit it finally. Besides that we were walking today and had a lot of calm, nice moments.

# 15 Juli - Montag - Berlin - 662 Tag der Einwanderung - Warm Sunny

One of the most important things in my life is to have a schedule. I don't put everything to this but I really thing it's crusial to have some big parts planned. I decided that tuesdays and wednesdays will be my office ones. I can change it only occasionally. Also I decide to stop using todoist. Yes, it's a cool piece of software but I don't use the full potentional of it. Payebal services are not for me. It's just my credo. I can pay for somthing only in case of unavoidable necessity. So, I moved all my deals to apple reminder. It will be enough. Also I started using apple calendar because I can accumulate all my calendart including business in one place. I really need it.

# 16 Juli - Diestag - Berlin - 663 Tag der Einwanderung - Warm Sunny

Office day was nice but annoying. I didn't sleep well and it made me soft and stupid. I aslo cannot find power for returning to sport again. I am not happy about myself. I should be changed. You can notice that I struggle with it for all my life. Unfortunatly I can't find specific motivation for doing sport on daily basis. Nothing can help me.

# 17 Juli - Mittwoch - Berlin - 664 Tag der Einwanderung - Warm Sunny

I was so tiered that just skip another Toastmasters meeting. It was bad but I could not. My office problem is still with me, I cannot focus there and cannot find power for concentration. The road is not destroying me anymore like it was in Saint-Petersburg, but the weather and my condition in general just remove all power from me. However who did say that I would be easy? I resolved all main immigrational problem but I still in some aftershock after all bullshit that happened to me. The life is not fair. It's just true.

# 18 Juli - Donnerstag - Berlin - 665 Tag der Einwanderung - Hot Sunny

My stepfather had a birthday today. Sometimes when I think about his and my mother's lifes I feel regret. They are so smart people but live in very bad conditions and don't have mental power for changing it. It's really sad. I wish them all the best but It's still very very sad. Besides that I was happy to work from home and having smooth day. I liked it so much. I need to anjust my schedule to that office visites. All my habits were shaped around fully remote work but now it changed. This is damn true.

# 19 Juli - Freitag - Berlin - 666 Tag der Einwanderung - Hot Sunny

I felt so tiered today that it is even hard to describe. I don't remember when I was so tired last time. I was working for a whole day on different interesting and not things and did my job. The temperature outside is really hot. It't not so easy to be concentrated on job due to it. However we did a small present to ourselfs this evening. We were in Thai massage salon. The main thing that it normal massage salon without happy end. It was really nice. I experienced such massage for the first time in my life. It was really nice. My back sad thank you to be. Surely It was imposible to pay by card there. It was no a surprice. I don't know if they just turned off pos terminal or payments didn't work due to huge fail on windows machines. It's not clear.

# 20 Juli - Samstag - Berlin - 667 Tag der Einwanderung - Hot Sunny

This saturday was absolutely cool as for me. Firstly I was in barbershop and now I look good. Secondly we were in Stadtbad Lichtenberg that is a historical city swimming pool that was opened in 1911 and closed in 1991 approximetely. This historical building in under recontruction now and sometimes people do exebitions there. THis pool will be closed in the end of the months, so we decided that it a good chance to check the building. I can say that it was really cool hostorical building. I hope it will be saved for future generations somehow. After visit to that place we got some burger and went to small museum in Shöneberg distict. The place was a shell gas station before and now it is a entrance to a museum and a caffee. We were not inside but drunk some coffee there. Then we decided to go for a walk and saw a huge street gay festival. I didn't know but shöneberg is a gay place here. There are a lot of gay bars, caffees, and shops. I was for the first time in such places. It was an interesting experience because in Russia you cannot see this on cities streets. It's absolutely prohibited. I am not a homophob and treat that people well, so I got some interesting experience. In the evening I jut sat at home and had a rest. Everything was really nice.

# 21 Juli - Sontag - Berlin - 668 Tag der Einwanderung - Hot Sunny

The weater was extremely hot today. It was 32 degrees but with high humidity that chnaged everything and made life harder. However the day was nice. We did't walk a lot today and mostly were at home. I dedicated a lot of time to my personal business and tasks that was nice and importnat. Also I did some other nice and cool thing like german lassons and finally proceeded with toastmasters preparations. Due to trip to Armenia I cannot prepare a speach strongly in advance and because of this I will plan in to the middle of september. It will be not so close to the day but importnat. I am going to join to the meetings remotly but not every wednesday. Until flight I will visit every toastmasters meetings including the next one that will be this wednesday. Also I decide to use more my ol computer because I find it cozier than work one. 13 inches screen seems to be better for me that 16 one. It's stragne but it is what it is. Maybe I will change my approach in the future but now this laptop I like more. Screen is not so big but enough for using the computer outside of apartments or something like this. It's completely different. Another thing that I want to add living in Germany is quite interesting experience that is different that I thought it might be. The difference is that it looks so trival and close to russian one but a little bit aside from I feel normal. It is really interesting.

# 22 Juli - Montag - Berlin - 669 Tag der Einwanderung - Warm Rainy

Thist day was nice but and I did really a lot of things. It's not so often thing last times but today I did something extraordinary. First of all I tasted my work finally. I had a good rest at night and it helped me to be ready for work. I did a lot of notes in my files, improved a lot of thigs, etc. Also I finally recieved my packages from temu with things that I wanted to obtain for some time. It's a case for documents and powerbank. My phone is not so good anymore and battery is quite tiered. If I go out for some walk and take photos the energy is going out very fast. So yes, now I am really better prepared for such situation. It's less than a month to my Armenia trip. I am going to close some bank accounts there and finally finish teeth treatment. I hope everything will be fine in this terms. So yes, the day productive and quite well done. I am glad about myself.

# 23 Juli - Dienstag - Berlin - 670 Tag der Einwanderung - Warm Rainy

I decided to apply a new approach for my deals. Now I write down everything I did during my days on my job in order ro remember what I was finished and what actually was going on. It helps me very much with selfcontrol. Besides that I was in the office today and the day was hard. I had tons of call about everything and was really tiered. I am actually still tiered. It is really hard people. I expected that it will be hard and it is.

# 24 Juli - Mittwoch - Berlin - 671 Tag der Einwanderung - Warm Sunny

Today I was in the office again. The pride month has been started in Germany and one of our colleges organized showing a show about drag queens. It was fun but a little bit too much. The thing is that I don't like it aesthetically. I grew up in different cultural and like more classic forms. I don't have anything against lgbrq+ people but I really love something different. It is what it is. However it was fun. In the evening I faced a weired situation with toastmasters. I came to a place that I thought to be a location for a meeting but I confuces addresses. The actual meeting was in a different location but the place has the same name. I was really angry because of sitation because I am so tired now and I gathered myself somehow to visit the place and so fucked up. It was sad.

# 25 Juli - Donnerstag - Berlin - 672 Tag der Einwanderung - Warm Sunny

I like to work from home. I hate office. The reason why people should be there sometimes is absolutely clear to me and I support it but I am fucking hate being in the office. I did a lot of things today. First of all I finilized step of speach preparation. It's really good. I need to find time for it but in general all is good with it. I need to adjust my schedule and reshape it to something really workable. Right now I fuck up every day with something unfortunately. It happend with both personal and work related tasks. I am very unstable in this sence.

# 26 Juli - Freitag - Berlin - 673 Tag der Einwanderung - Warm Rainy

If you are a normal person you like friday like I do. So, I overslept today. It happens very rarely with me and I was surprised. I just didn't head my alarm. However I did a lot of things and participated in all meetings. I still working on adjusting of the schedule. In the evening we were on Deadpool and Wolverin cinema. I enjoyed it very much despite the fact that some phrases were unclear to me. Yes, the movie was in original english. It was really cool. Also I am really exited of fact that I can watch some movies in Russian in Yerevan. It will be really really cool. On monday I need to ask for a vacation and then inform others that I am going to have it soon this year.

# 27 Juli - Samstag - Berlin - 674 Tag der Einwanderung - Warm Rainy

Berlin's summer is really rainy I must say. It's not what I excpected. however we were walking today a lot. Firsly we spent the morning in some pleasant routine and then ejoyed a pizza in a local cafe. After that we just sat in metro and came to Tiergarten station. There is a huge zoo that was founded in Soviet times in eastern Berlin. The place is really big and it is actually a huge park. We were walking and enjoyed the time. After coming back home I was so tiered that could not stand. I am writing these lines and go to sleep just after finishing them. 

# 28 Juli - Sontag - Berlin - 675 Tag der Einwanderung - Warm Rainy

The rain is still here. It's amazing. Well. this day was dedicated to cleaning of the apartments. We are going to Yerevan in two weeks and it would be cool to keep the home clean. I cleaned my part and helped Ksusha a little bit with her one. Also I were walking today a lot because I need to keep my legs in tonus. I was so scared by my previouse surgery that the sport is the part of my life again now. I gradually introduce it to my life again. Tomorrow morning I am going to do some excercises. It's just important for my health. Also I am not going to office tomorrow that makes me happy. I hate it.

# 29 Juli - Montag - Berlin - 676 Tag der Einwanderung - Warm Sunny

Unfortunatrly, my german teacher was not able to do leesson today. He could not because the internet connection in his Bremen's apartments was bad and he asked to cancel lessons for the next two weeks. It's sad and I don't like it, but I have to deal with it somehow. In general the day was nice, I was at home today and I really like it. I am going to the office only on Thirsday and Friday. I decided to do it because I want to count that days to August statistics due to my trip to Yerevan.

# 30 Juli - Dienstag - Berlin - 677 Tag der Einwanderung - Warm Sunny

I finally sent an email to XU CEO. It includes some critics of their HR department work. It's really low chance to be read but I did it and I am proud of myself. For the last two months I feel so bad in terms of my self-confidence. It's really strage thing. It's so bad that I decided to gradually go out of this shit. In other case I will not be able to live normally unfortunately. I set so many interesting and cool goals that I need to achieve somehow. I need to be consistent.

# 31 Juli - Mittwoch - Berlin - 678 Tag der Einwanderung - Warm Sunny

Today I finally visited toastmasters meeting. It was really nice and cool. I had fun that was really important. After returning from Yerevan I am going to visit meetups again. I want to schedule at least two ones every month. I need to comunicate to people. It will be fun and really valuable. However I need to mention bad stuff happened to me today. The main and only thing is that I feel toothache. It's very annoying. A peace of my tooth broked and my denta is in pain. It's really bad and only thing that makes me calm is a soon visit to Armenia. My doctor is there. He will remove all that shit and fix it.

# 01 August - Donerstag - Berlin - 679 Tag der Einwanderung - Warm Sunny

The day was nice despite that I had to spend time in office. I don't like it, you know. Since I was there for a whole nothing really important happened. However in the evening me and Ksusha were in Templhof where I finally stand on my skateboard. I enjoyed it very much. Of course due to my flyight to Armenia I cannot repeat it again until I come back. I will not have time for it. Additionally I started recording of my pppodcasts. It's one of the first steps towards returning of my self-confidence that I lose due to huge stress. It's nice.

# 02 August - Freitag - Berlin - 680 Tag der Einwanderung - Warm Sunny

Another office day was today. I am so tiered. I think that our HR's department has some unique tendency to hire young russian speaking women. It's so strange. After office I met Ksusha on ex-Mercedes platz that is Uber platz now. We were in a cinema and whatched "Trap" movie. It was a thriller about maniac that was trapped on a music concert. The movie was naive a little bit but well shaped. I enjoyed. I needed to what something light and enjoying. Also during of writing this lines I realized that forgot to turn 2nd of August back on this machine. It happened because I tested something today that was related to wrong date. I tested a specific case when a client and a server have diffrent dates and times.

# 03 August - Samstag - Berlin - 681 Tag der Einwanderung - Warm Sunny

I like saturdays. I like them especially when my tierdness starting destroyin me. Today was exact that case. We cleaned the apartment in the first part of the day. that was nice. I hate to do it but I had to because we are going to armenia in the end of the next week.  After that we were in the future museum where founders of that place tried to convince me that I need to save planet. I am not against it but I don't believe in everything that then push to me. This is true. After that we were at home and just enjoyed saturday.

# 04 August - Sontag - Berlin - 682 Tag der Einwanderung - Warm Sunny

It was the last sunday in this berlins summer. I will meet autumn in Yerevan. We were in chinese restaraunt today that offer bowls with soup that can assemble by your own. The problem was that they prohibited sharing of that dish between several persons. I hate this. I cannot understand what is wrong with that peoples. I paid for a dish and can to everything I want with it. You got my money, so fuck off. I don't undestand this totally. They can fuck themselvs. I am not against it. After that we were walking here and there. That episode with the bowl was the only bad thing happened today. It was sad but ok. fuck them.

# 05 August - Montag - Berlin - 683 Tag der Einwanderung - Warm Sunny

The heavy week has been started today. I need to be in the office daily because I am flying to Armenia very soon.
