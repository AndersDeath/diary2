# 01 January - Sunday - Tbilisi - 94 day of immigration

2023 has been started. I don't like to use this nice numbers for tarting doing something, but I think that 2023 is a good year for starting a new life. Surely It's not the first time when I start a new life, but being and living is not something sustainable, it's constantly changing thing. I already have a plan for those changes. First of all mind and body should be main things for me. I'm not in good condition really. I need to focus. I need to change this bad approach. 2022 was a year of mind growing. 2023 should be not only about studying, but also about physical perfection. I cannot be super healthy bodybuilder kind man, but at least I need to fix some health problems like my small belly having and just small muscles. It's a good goal, that I need to achieve.

# 02 January - Monday - Tbilisi - 95 day of immigration

Today I moved another several repositories from bitbucket to github. We walked a bit around and found that prices are extremely expensive here. It's something abnormal. It's out of normal. Nevermind, Tomorrow I'm going to try record a video in English. I hope this will be ok and I will publish it.But at least I will record a video in Russian. I will do it tomorrow morning while Ksusha is on lesson with her designer tutor. I also use some wine today. It's extremely rare thing, but I did it. Wow, One important thing - I send my cv to several companies. The seeking job has been started. I'm happy. It's really time.

# 03 January - Tuesday - Tbilisi - 96 day of immigration

I've recorded sources for the next video. Probably today I will finish it and publish on youtube. I like this practice because it's more interesting that recording audio pppodcast. It looks like era of pppodcasts has been finished. Also Ksusha has sport today, during this moment I am going to record english video. It will be my first effort to record normal video using foreign language. I finally finished with Rhetoric of Story and got simple certificate. It's funny. So, I finished with almost full list of my deals that I needed to finish. That's good. I feel much better when I can finish something important and interesting. However I need to do much more for finishing all things. From tomorrow I will start recalling basic algorithms. I already started doing it on coursera, but I really don't remember anything. I think I need to reshape the information and memorize it this way.

# 04 January - Wednesday - Tbilisi - 97 day of immigration

Today I was working for the most part of the day. Very soon I will go for a walk, but now I want to write down some thoughts. First of all I finally continued learning process and this is amazing. I studied English today and some product thinking stuff. Also I registered in Mastodon which is a web3 twitter analogue. I still doesn't know how it exactly works but it's interesting. Significant part of the day was in fight with final cut pro as result I removed this shit and downloaded and installed adobe premiere. Tomorrow I will try to do something using this tool. I waste a lot of time and didn't record a video in English which is shame and I didn't look for vacancies. I need to find time for fixing it. Also I need to mention that service in Georgia is still awful. Today Glovo brought someone's else order. It is a shame because every day something goes wrong with local deliveries. It was the last time when I tried it. I don't want to use it anymore. Food deliveries in Yerevan work significantly better. Also I need to mention that prices here are incredible hight. Abnormally hight I would say.

# 05 January - Thursday - Tbilisi - 98 day of immigration

I red a lot of vacancies today and I would say that I'm not so good. I need to change focus. I need to record videos faster and constantly. also it looks like if I want to be relocated to US I probably need to try looking for team lead position. Surely it depends on salary, but anyway. I studied a lot today work on rhetoric and algorithms. Also we went to Georgia expo. It's a bunch of buldings that were buit in USSR and now it reshaped to restaraunts and buisinesses. So I also set up adobe premiere and tomorrow I will finish with new video. Returning to vacancies, despide the problem with this topic I applyed to several variants.

# 06 January - Friday - Tbilisi - 99 day of immigration

Today we walked a bit. We finally visitet local stronghold and botanic garden. That are quite nice places. Afte rthat we had a good dinner in balkony 12 restaraunt, which is also very nice. Also I investigated topic of cover letters. I already have one, but I need to update it. defenetly I will do it tomorrow. I also significantly improved editing of my new video that I'm gonig to publish very soon. Adobe premiere doesn't surprise in accinetal moment like final cut does. Everything works correct and fine. I will finish with editing tomorrow. Another problem that I started understand songs that I loved when I was a kid. It sucks. By the way, tomorrow will be the latest full day in Tbilisi for me. I dont's want to come back here again soon. Armenia seems more prefferable country for me.

# 07 January - Saturday - Tbilisi - 100 day of immigration

It was the last full day in Tbilisi for us. We had a gool walk and rode of funicular. I've wrote it in Russian transcription because I don't know how do it in Eglish correctly. Nevermind, we walked a lot and also visitet not only the highest point in Tbilisi but also Rustaveli street and Balcony 12 restaraunt. Fortunately it was a nice day without any problems. I also applied several vacancies and reshaped cover letter. Maybe someone will answer me. I would be great. Also I analyzed sevaral things and probably found the next startup project for investigation. I think I didn't mention that I tryed one of my progect in startup canvas and it was aweful. Project that I dreamed about doesn't make sense as a new business. I need to figure out with something else and I have it. Also I moved all interesting for me repositories from butbucket to github. this is very good because I have some old history there now. I will probably move something else, but I still don't decided if it's a good idea. I will do it tomorrow I suppose, because i will have enough time for it. Our driver is going to pick us up at 8 am. Estimated time for arrival to Yerevan is 1-2pm I think. I hope there will be not lines on Georian-Armenian border. So, yes, I will text here something tomorrow. Thank you very much for everything and good luck. See you people.

# 08 January - Sunday - Tbilisi - Yerevan - 101 day of immigration

The driver was late. He was half an hour late. He told us than he didn't sleep at night because of another client. So, He found another drive that moved to Yerevan. This time Armenian officer asked a lot of questions. Their attention to us changed. It's something new. Anyway I crossed the border successfully. Now I am in Yerevan. The apartments looks good. the weather is quite cold unfortunately. Besides, the houses here were built for warm weather and now it's quite cold inside. Also I ffel like I've forgotten English for these 15 day without talks with natives. At the same time I didn't do anything today. I slept really bad, probably only for 3 hours. Also I spent the half of the day in the car and when I came to apartments I got lunch and then went to sleep. So, tomorrow I need to go working for DRSMILE again. I am tiered of this company and in order to be calmer I will proceed meditation. Now I will try to wite a bit code ! It will be good.

# 09 January - Monday - Yerevan - 102 day of immigration

Today I almost done with everything I planned. IT's very cool. Also I scheduled surgeey. It will be in thursday. I am happy because I really wanted to do it as soon as possible. It mean that maybe in 6 months I will have new teeth which is amazing. I also came back to full working days. I try do as much as I can. I didn't have time to finish only one thing - video. Maybe today's evening I can to do it. I neeed to edit just couple of minutes and put outro, that's it. I can also say that it's hard for my back to sit on chair that I have in the new apartmens. It's shitty. I got cool news about my euity. It looks like I will have huge benefit. YEsteddays evening I decided that I will do a project that will be helper for creatio of CV. I think it will be nice.

# 10 January - Tuesday - Yerevan - 103 day of immigration

Today I had a much more power for work which is amazing. I did a lot of stuff including bug fixed and som new features. Usually I spend a lot fo time on studying and this day wasn't an exeption. I studyied rhetorics again, agrogithms and wrote a bit an article. Also I finally published a vide about new year celebration in Georgia. It's good because now I can look at recording the next episode and at the same time focus on english video. this is my goal, to start recoding english videos. I want to create another armenian channel where I will pubish hat new videos. they will be not a part of russian context which is cool. Very soon I will go to the barber. I need to cut hair and beard a bit.

# 11 January - Wednesday - Yerevan - 104 day of immigration

I've fixed a lot of stuff on NNEC project. Also, I watched couple of videos related to English. I also did some research in front-end area, worked on scenario and on another writing things. Tomorrow is a big day. I'm going to get surgery. The surger wil screw in 5 teeth. It will be amazing. I'm happy. Also today was the last day when I had to shot my ass. I mean cikloferon of course. It's cool, because it's not so fun to have pain in the ass. In general, mymood is quite calm today, this is cool, I think. 

# 12 January - Thursday - Yerevan - 105 day of immigration

I'm going to Surgeon in 10 minutes. I'm really scared today. I don't know what happened with me. Usually, I feel good before operations. Today I feel something different. Hopefully this was a nice surgery everything went well. Te pain that I felt right after operation was extrimely aweful. I barely survived until the house where I took a pill. Now I am ok. Shortly I am going to SAS and get some dinner, then I will go back home and have a rest. So, from work perspective I only investigated Supabase. It's an altenative to Firebase. It's free and it's why I think that the servise bight be useful for me. It's already prebuilded backend, literally. I also read book a bit and watched a lot of youtube videos. It's cold in Yerevan by the way.

# 13 January - Friday - Yerevan - 106 day of immigration

Today I felt good. Fortunately I am not old guy and recovery process is fast for me. I also had a full day of meeting and it was very painful. Also I was investigating things fro quick creation of projects. I think that I now have a backend solution for building quick prototypes of things. Also I didn't record pppodcast for a very long time. I have a plan to record it very soon this weekend. It's important to keep habits, especially if they are useful. Today I also was writing article. I became much more fluent in writing. I am happy that my skills improved. Unfortunately VSCode doesn't have spelling plugin. Because of it I still cannot fix mistakes in this texts.

# 14 January - Saturday - Yerevan - 107 day of immigration

Today I was  a cheat meal. We walked around Yerevan's city center. We visited a new restaurant, I don't remember the name of it, unfortunately. Also I feel better than yesterday, but still not so good. I've set up spelling checker to VSCode that helps me in writing these notes. I hope that there will be less mistakes in texts than usual. I've started investigating of new technologies that were created in big quantities for the last several years. It's nice by the way ,because I found several projects that will help me a lot in prototype creation. Also I forgot about ine important piece of news. I finally finished reading of Inspired book which is about product management. I helped me a lot in understanding of what exactly product managers do. It's definitely important for my personal progress.

# 15 January - Sunday - Yerevan - 108 day of immigration

today I also was working on my things. I filled a report for my accountant. Also I was working on my new article. It's really long process for me because I decided ignoring Russian and write directly in English. It's absolutely weighted decision. I don't see any future in that part of the world. So, I also was working on Reactjs investigation. I tried Hugo project. It's another static website generator. I will maybe use in in the future. I didn't make a decision about it. Today I got feeling of pleasure when I was working on article. It's new feeling for me. I want to proceed working on it, because it's cool. I also finally sent documents to Nastya. CDEK still works.

# 16 January - Monday - Yerevan - 109 day of immigration

I improved today the readme prototype. It looks better, but still not suitable for production. I prepared plan minimum for the project. I finished with 3 fields, but even now I see that It needs to start using state management system. It will be definitely redux. Also I read a bit about system design. It's cool and very useful for me. I watched english lessons. Now I know about Oxford comma and that this rule is controversial. I recalled about my leadership course which I have to finish before 6 of February. It looks like I don't have a lot of time and need to spend more time on it. Besides those things I was working a lot on DRSMILE's release. I think that we will push to production one thing that is not so interesting. Podolog visit is planned for 26 of January. I will see what exactly happened with my feet. I also feel better today. I'm still puffy, but it's not so noticeable. Very shortly I will go to SAS. I need to have a dinner. I am hungry. It's about 7pm now.

# 17 January - Tuesday - Yerevan - 110 day of immigration

Today I was working on DRSMILE release. Interesting that I feel myself broken. Today I had a lot of meetings and discussed a lot of things. I tried to write several lines of Java code. I don't like this language, but I see that I need to know it. A lot of vacancies have this language in the requirements list. Also I feel that speak English worse. I need to start training tomorrow again. It's bad. Also I didn't have time to proceed working on articles. I didn't have time for recording new vide as well. I suppose that I fill record another diary tomorrow. By the way it's interesting that github thinks that this repository is "SHELL". it's fun, because practically all lines are markdown. Tomorrow I will try to be better.

# 18 January - Wednesday - Yerevan - 111 day of immigration

As usual I was coding for the most part of the day. We are very close to the crucial release that should be in the last year. this is good. Also I was on the All Hands Meeting, which is basically the meeting where c level management gives an information about company's health. the deals in not so good. Profitability rate decreased a lot. It was 5 million euros minus in December. It's not so good for my share that I have in DRSMILE. The big thing is that I recorded a vide today. when I have time I will edit it and publish. As usual. I still work on readme project which will be a part of resume builder that I will do right after it. There are a lot of people who do the same, but I think I can do better. Again, it's a service, not a toy.

# 19 January - Thursday - Yerevan - 112 day of immigration

I finally released big project within DRSMILE. This is amazing and I feel relief. Because of that I will have more time for my personal project. Unfortunately I didn't have enough time for other things. I also was on a call with HR from Portugal. It's extremely sad that I cannot join to their company. They don't support relocation. Tomorrow I will go to the hospital the will cut stitches from my jaws. Also I want to edit video tomorrow. in general things are going well, but I still focus on everything. I don't want to have problems or be fired. One thing, I found a bit time for studying today, which is amazing thing. And I am very tiered.

# 20 January - Friday - Yerevan - 113 day of immigration

Yesterdays DR SMILE release caused an issue. 1200 wrong notifications were sent to people. It's not so much and we found how to resolve them. I was working a bit on writing. Also I've understood that I need to create a deadline for my articles. Without it I will do it forever without positive result. So, from tomorrow I will do everything this way. In general I extremely tiered of the week. I also want to remake my schedule, because I planned a lot and don't have time for everything. So, yea. Every day since the 1st of January I apply to 5 vacancies. It's not a surprise, but I don't get any response. I had only one interview with the person who thought I am in Portugal. I need to groom and change this process as well.

# 21 January - Saturday - Yerevan - 114 day of immigration

I was doing good today. I wrote several lines of text and published short notes in TG. I also tried to edit video, but source of it was awful. I just recorded another one which I'm going to edit tomorrow. We walked a lot today. We did about 15000 steps which is good. Cheat meal is another topic. It was amazing. Tomorrow I am going to dedicate the day for education. I need to edit and publish a vide and watch a lot of studying videos. Also I published several things to holy-theory. It's just something like a book that I want to write. I will publish examples to that place and add some text to articles. Anyway, tomorrow will sunday. It's also very good.

# 22 January - Sunday - Yerevan - 115 day of immigration

Today I was watching videos about management and leadership. I have to finish some courses faster. I think that I dedicate my time wrong way sometimes. Additionally I finished with editing of the new video. Tomorrow I will check it, render, and publish. I finished writing ine small article that I will publish on Tuesday. After that I can be more focused on english video script. It's really cool that I cancelled watching youtube and waste my time. I'm extremely exited about writing english script. I have some ideas about management. I want to focus my english channel on technical and managerial stuff. It will be amazing. I also realized that I have a very cool tool that I can use. It's alter-ego. It's really hard for me to talk to someone or do presentations by myself and I believe that it's will absolutely easy for that guy. Anyway. It will be tomorrow all future week.

# 23 January - Monday - Yerevan - 116 day of immigration

I had a full day of meeting. It's not a surprise by the way. It's very common thing. However I found time for publishing a video. Tomorrow I will publish my fist small little tiny article in English. there is nothing worth, but It will be significant for me personally. Also I got an invitation from Booking.com. It everything is ok I will go to the interview with them. Let's see. In general I had a lot of English practice today. It's very good because I have problems with it. I don't have enough conversations with colleges. Today I had a one hour conversation with Narayan which is Indian guy and it's definitely important to use English for conversation with him. In general I am happy about what I have now. I think that I need to be strong. Something like warrior ha-ha-ha =)

# 24 January - Tuesday - Yerevan - 117 day of immigration

Today I again had a full day of meeting. I again found 5 vacancies and sent cv. I finally paid attention on Apple, Uber, Netflix, etc. I sent resume to them.
