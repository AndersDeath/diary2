# 01 October - Saturday - İstanbul - 2 day of immigration 

The situation hasn't changed. I am still here in İstanbul.
The taxi service there is surprisingly aweful. Uber and others doesn't work properly.
Here taxi drivers select you, not you do it with them. That's very strange. 
It looks like you are in a trap and cannot plan your trip without problems. Sadly it is true. А 
Despite this problem, the day was amaizing. 
We visited several places of Istanbul bienale, nice restaraunt nad metro bridge. after that we went to hamam and massage, that were awesome. we really spent good time, despite the fact that we are extrimely tiered now. From tomorrow I will try to go back to meditation and other practices that help we to survive in this fucking world. maybe I will look at criterias for cto and em.
I need to continue my life and live as it was before the war and fucking putin madness. sure, i cannot understand how to become legal person in this fucking world, but i am sure that i will find a way. the most important thing is to make all documents and find a way how to recieve shengen visa. But, honestly guys, My desiere to bacome an eu citizes is much less. i see that european values are bullshit and shittalk. it's just fucking fiction.
i think a lot about south america, maybe that place is much better that fucking hypocritical europe. now i am going to sit a bit on sofa and read book. i didn't it for very long time bacouse of stress. By the way, Russia retreats in Ukrain. it looks like Putin will be defeated. I hope this fucking facist will recieve all that he deserved. I do not know what the better for him, knot or prison. His crime is so obvious that i think execution shoud be fair and quick.

# 02 October - Sunday - Istanbul - 3 day of immigration

Today is new third day of immigration. i think it is fair to count days from this trip, because things that happened in march were calmer and more understanable. i know that I thought about it in different way, because i was scared. Hovewer now I believe that March was a soft month. It's really wierd to live without understanding what I will hape in the future. it's hard and silly. Ath the same tim I am still in thack with my experiment of daily commints to GitHub. Today is 277th day of pushing. thats really nice. i write code not every day, but i consider all kinds of activities as a programming, even if it is diary notes. The explanaition is very simple, all activities that i do are for my own perfection. anyway, today i need to finish several important things. for example i need to analyze CTO and eM requiretments. it's an important task that will boost my career in the future. I also need to be focused more on this day, and think less about the past. I cannot change anything, yes, i do not want to accept this reality, but I have no choice. only this day and future matter. i really think more about immigration to US. Mahybe not more in general, but i've been thinking about it for the last two or three days constantly. Only future and this day matter. i will tattoo it on my hard. Although you know, from the point of view of philosophy, the present does not exist, since the moment in which we live immediately becomes the past. So, i need to go, maybe I will add some lines here in the evening.

# 03 October - Monday - Istanbul - 4 day of immigration

Today is the first day after starting of mobilization when I work effectively. I did a lot for surevey engine. Tomorro I will implement fully workable prototype of it within Drsmile portal. At the same time i want to share the engine of it with populus. also i still think a lot about what happened. Essentially it looks like i can be outlaw in russia if they summon me to the army. As you know i strongly disagree with it and will not go to country before putin's falling and cancelling of all that stupid new laws. It's realy sad that I do not know if i come back home. I didn't do anything bad, but I am outlaw. It's wierd. The counry might be against me not because I killed someone, but beause I do not want to kill anyone. It's abosolutely new narrative. In simple words this thing is bullshit. again. I need to have a rest a bit and then I will make a desigion, what I can do with it. Again, it's abosolutely unclear. Today Gosduma - russian parlament ratified the decree on the annexation of regions of Ukraine. i think next week Federaton soviet will ratified this as well. Then Putin could start the super war. At the same time, interesting news have been come. Three men has been dead in army. I mean mobilized men, but ordinary soldiers. They probably the first victims of this process.

# 04 October - Tuesday - Istanbul - 5 day of immigration

Today i had a full day of meetings. because of it I didn't have enough time for working on mmy perosnal projects. After that I went to restaraunt with Ksusha which was on roof in the hostorical center of Istanbul. By the way, today is 5th day of immigration. Also I had an interview with Iranian guy who wants to be a part of Drsmile. I didn't like him honestly. Tomorrow I will have more time for coding and dealing with my business. it's nice.

# 05 October - Wednesday - Istanbul - 6 day of immigration

I've done a lot of things today. It was really cool. In the evening we went to exibitoin of one local artist. It was quite interesting. At the same time we faced with a problem of payments from Ineco to russia. We spent evening in attempts to find way to resolve it. Tomorrow we will proceed. Also today is te final dau in istanbul when we can just walk. Tomorrow we will flight to Egypt and then we will go to Bodrum.

# 06 October - Thursday - Istanbul - 6 day of immigration

Today is the last day in istanbul. i've packed all my stuff to suitcases and backpacks. The hole day i spent of programming. We found an instruction how to sned money to russia from ineco. Probably it will work. We need some time for testing this approach. Now I am goint to cook a dinner and then we will got to the airport. This night we will be in Egypt. It will be my first visit there. I hope I will spend good time there. So, they flight was quite well. Unfortunately the drunk guy sat near us and did wierd things. He was from Germany, but was born in Turkmen SSR and then he immigrated to Germany. He is Armenian by the way and huge Putins fan. It was interesting case to talk to him, bacause all that he knows about Russia are from TV shows. Survey he has different view on the situaction.

# 07 October - Friday - Sharm El-Sheikh - 7 day of immigration

Today I woke up in Sharm El-SHeiks hotel near Red sea. You probably remember that this place was in the Bible. So, the hottel is quite nice despite the fact taht it's old. food is ok, the day was also ok. I didn't write a line of code because of full day of memtings. I even didn't have time to fisnish all documentation. I wil do it tomorrow or the day after tomorrow. I also want ot do it, because it will be basis for my future article. The internet here is quite slow. I've bought an additional speed today, without this it was really hard to be on calls with team. So, I also is thinking about situation that happened yeterday in the airport when Ksusha started shouting on turkish guy who was absolutely impolite and stupid. Anywas It would be a proble,m but fotrunately nothing bad happened. I assume that her behaviur is a reaction to all that happened this year. All our plans ruined and event live was in danger zone. As I like to say, Putin is piece of shit. Today is his birthday by the was. He is 70 today. I wish him not to reach out of 71. He is a murderer and stupid fanatic. And even worse he is facist. I hate it. I cannot accept this. It's not fair that happened. The war should be stopped. Putin shoud be prisoned.

# 08 October - Saturday - Sharm El-Sheikh - 8 day of immigration

Actually today is the first vacation day. I will be free of DR SMILE for the next 2 weeks which is amazing. I have no power for working. I need some break and I will get it. Putin got a present for his birthday. Crimea bridge was blown up this night. I saw a viede on the interten about it. A truck loaded with explosives exploaded on one of lines there. The train with fule or oil was nearby and also exploded and fired for all night. Ukranians found the way how to do this. I think it will be considered as terroristic act in Russia. But I should admit that it is the success of Ukranians. At the same time, this gives confidence that they can start blowing up anything on the territory of Russia. In this sense it is of course terroristic action. I am happy that I fled from the country. Finally I returned to my article about angular + firebase + firestore. It's really cool. Moreoverr I've updated documentation for survey project. I will proceed working on article and survey tomorrow. Also I do not forget about other projects. But they became parts of my current initiatives. At the same time I need to select some center of expertise that I will share with people. Obviously that will be peogramming, management, and startups.

# 09 October - Sunday - Sharm El-Sheikh - 9 day of immigration

So, today I finally finished with EM and CTO criterias analysing. It means that I can start slow preparations to the my funute success. Joke. I also did several interesting things: finished one book, downloaded new one, etc. I also spent time on the beach, wich was nice. I was lying on a lounger and thought about different things. Tomrrow I am going to come back to my schedule and proceed learning languages and improving other skills. Actually I will work as usual, but without DR SMILE. That is amazing. I really need this break. I dreamed about it. I want to record some videos, pppodcast and finish some immigration investigation. I need plan. Plan makes me calm. By the way, meditation also helps me. Now I will go and read book. I didn't do it for very long time. But here, in this hotel it nothing to do exept thinking and reading. B y the way, this type of rest is not mine favourite. I think it is the last time when I do it this way. Here is really noting to do and at the same time a lot of things are prohibited. This place doesn't have proper beach, only riff and small pier for jumping to the sea. I thought to buy scooba diving session, but I changed my mind. this place is so boring, and I do not want to pay money without any choise. And you know because of absense of selections the prices are quite hight. It's boolshit.

# 10 October - Monday - Sharm El-Sheikh - 10 day of immigration

Today Russia answered to blowing up of Crimea bridge. They attacked sevral cities. however today is my first vacation day. It's monday but I do not work. Nice. Also there is a cool piece of news. Portugal officially announced digital nomad visa. It's cool. It means that I will maybe have possibility to immigrate to this country cheaper that I thought. Other time I was reading books and sleeping. To be honest I am afraid of my future. Let see what we will have in the future. We've came to the hot part of that war. We also cnnot predict how Erope will react on it. I realy dream about finish of the war. It's really hard to live this times. I cannot understand feeling of Ukranians, but I can imagine it. it's a horror of war. It's nightmare that cannot stop. Nevermind. I've got a very stong mochito today. I thing Egyptions put more alchole that they should. It's really stong thing. I also dived with scooba today. It's bullshot. Riff is beatufult, but it's very deep underneath. So, I will go to the dinner. I am really starving. After taht I maybe add something, but I am not sure.

# 11 October - Tuesday - Sharm El-Sheikh - 11 day of immigration

Today I finally recorded pppodcast. I also coded a bit. It will get a patent for this word "coded". Tomorrow is the latest day here. I don't want to repeat this experience really. It's full of shit thing honestly. I also has written down a scheme about temporary residency in Armenia. Also I think a lot about visa to Portugal and getting new residency there. This is my next life goal. As a mentioned before I preapred a table with skills for EM and CTO positions. I need to improve some things and then get new job. I really want to become a CTO in some company and do great product. At the same time It will bring me money that I want. Well, I also going to whatch one interesting live on Youtube about new digital nomad visa of Portugal. I am exited about it and I hope it will be easy way to get residency in that country. I also read a lot of stuff about management. My next goal is to dive deeper into Agile process and into scrum particullary. I want to start with it and then move futher. By the way the next step of mobilization has been started by fucking Putin. They started bombing Ukranian cities again. They decided to destroy this country. It's horrible.

# 12 October - Wednesday - Sharm El-Sheikh - 12 day of immigration

English lessons brcame interesting for me again. Today I've started learning english idioms. This is my weak point. At the same time I've procceded with escape from building trap book. However it was just 10 minutes. Shortly I will proceed reading book about habits. IT will be more useful in this context. I still have reading list that I need to finish. Yesterday I finished reading Goosebumps book by Stine. I red it when I was a teenager and I really enjoed that stuff. Nowadays I decided to read it once again but in English. Vocabulary there is quite easy and understandagle. I can read it for fun and at the same time explore some new workds and features. I think that is good idea to read teenager's books for trainig all kind of new languages. You are like repeat the same way of loangulage traning that you used for your native one. Essentially you do the same thing but when you become older. Very soon I will go to swim for the last time in Sharm El-Sheikh. I am going to leave Egypt this night. Time has come. We will go to Istanbul and then the day after tomorrow we are flying to Bodrum which will be our home for the next 2 months. I also will try to add some notes in the evening if I have time and them. 

Dinner was nice. I am sitting in my room now and going to pack my things. Then I will probably read a book until check out time. I've paid all bills this morning and already got confirmation from taxist. Only one bad thing there. I think that a local airport doesn't have free wi-fi. Only book and timekilling like writing texts can rescue me from to be bored. Anyway. I wish a good flight to myself.

# 13 October - Thursday - Istanbul - 13 day of immigration

This night was tough. About 3.20 am we left Sharm El-Sheikh. The airport was in quite old. Some places were dirty. There are several safety lines of control. The first one is the entrance to ariport territory. The second one is on main entrance into building. The third one is just after entrance. The fourth one is just after passport control. All that checks are very careful and strong. The couse is very simple, several years ago terrorists blowed up russian airplane with hundreds of tourists. All people died. Russian government prohibited flights to Egypt after that and Egypt's athorities changed security rules. Let go back to my flight. After 3 hours in the air and landing delay we finally reached out Istanbul Sabiha Gokcen Havalimani. Afte one hour and thirty minutes in parssport control queue we finally went to the country. airbnb host picket up us on car and I can say big thanks to him.
Me and Ksusha slept for half a day and then we got pilates traning and we went to Shopping mall. After buying some good we came back to the apartments.  Today I spent more than your in local metro and it is quite new expierence for me. I tried Istanbul metro before but I did spend so much time there. Well, Asian part of this metropolis is not so historical like eropiean one. It is the real place where people live. There is no city plan. Streets are not straight and it looks like Istanbul grows due to joining small villages in neighbourhood. Anyway It is interesting. I also took several photos today I will share them later. Tomorrow morning we are going to fly to Bodrum. We will be there until december and then we should change palce. It's very high probability that it will be Armenia. I don't want to come back there now, but I think I will have to do it. Actually I have no choice. Lovely, I wrote down many words. Now I need to sleep. See you later.

# 14 October - Friday - Istanbul - Bodrum - 14 day of immigration

Today is exact 2 weeks of immigration. I am really want to go back home. It's more hard this time. I'm tired of all this flights and living in places where I don't want to live. This is absolutely fuck up situation. Now I'm sitting in airport and waiting for boarding. It's about an hour more to wait. Today's eveinig I will be in Bodrum, even afternoon to be precise. By the way, an hour ago I've tested Perasus airline automanic registration system. I've checked in on the spcial terminal and registred my luggage. Everything worked fine. I think that last time I've just faced with very rude person.

I've reached out our Bodrum base. It was the first time when we faced with transfer problems. Firm that should provide it to use just didn't come. Due to tthis we had to get a taxi to our apartments. Sure It was not so convinient, but we successfully came here. Booking obligated to fire back money for the transfer and taxi. The place looks like a village with hotels. This is quite place where I really want to finish with some my business. It's funny that this morning I was in Istanbul and now I am in many kilometres from that place. I like tachnologies and airplanes. Tomorrow we need to buy some necessary stuff. So, but honestly I still don't understand if this I like this place, but I will be here for approximetly two months.

# 15 October - Saturday - Gündoğan - Turgutreis - 15 day of immigration

So, as I understood I don't live in Bodrum but in Gündoğan. It's a city not so far from Bodrum but this is not exact this place. I think it's very important and as a result I will use only this place as a reference. We visited to Turgutreis. It's a Bodrum's district. Ksusha wanted to get maniquere there. It's very nice place with marina and beautiful embankment. I was nerveus becaouse of taxi system here. It's really hard to call taxi without problems. Uber doesn't work here and drivers don't speak english. But woman from Kazakhstan which makes maniquere hepled us and gave a number of illegal taxi that helps us reach out all points. i also have a plan to find information about buses. It might be more useful in perspecitve of price. I think I will be nice. Today was a quite calm day. I prepeared a lot for my sharenium project. Tomorrow I will start workable version. It will be very alpha version. I still don't understand how I will handle all this stuff from updates perspective. Anyway I think it will be my first pulic project. Also I need to prepare nice landing page for the project. It will be the next step. Oh, I've recalled a thing. Today I used google translate for conversation with taxist. It was my first expierence in comunication this way. Now I will go and rest a bit.

# 16 October - Sunday - Gündoğan - 16 day of immigration

Today I finished a lot of tasks. I finally started mt sharenium project in very early alpha version. I am really happy bacause of it. At the same time I went for a walk for a while and got nice time. Unfortunately problems with ineco card happend in the evening. it's wierd that card didn't work in a shop, but I sucessfully payed for skype by the same card. Anyway I ineco customer support told me that it's just a problem with ineco not with me because of my sitting in Turkey. Calls by MTS Armenia are very expensive. I've put arout 8000 dram and it was enougt only for 3 minutes. But anyway I am happy that it is not a problem on my side. Tomorrow i will work hard on shrenium ui. Maybe I will buy sharenium domain. Anyway I am exited about this project. Tomorrow I will make refactoring and then will look at this. Ow, I've forgotted to mention that I have a nice conversation with Oleg. I will call him more often. And I want to consider that I became calmer than I was.

# 17 October - Monday - Gündoğan - 17 day of immigration

Today I was working on articles mostly. The same thing I will do tomorrow. I worked a bit on my sharenium project. Now it's not necessary to buy domain name. I found a lot of architectual problems there. I need to fix them initially. Tomowwor I will start working by my usual schedule. It's time to dive back to the languages and other inportant stuff. Ineco bank resolved all problems and now card works well. I already tested it in small restaraunt and a supermarket. At the same time I found that this apartments are not so ocnvinient for work. Terrace is not useful, the same stuff is with veranda. I need to resolve it somehow, but I do not know how. Will see. This evening we will go for a walk. I want to look at harbour or I like to call it marina. I also recalled that we finished with movie Brazil by by Terry Gilliam. I was really impressed my this work. I agree it's masterpiece. Autocracy as is. I live in this env, and I can say that it's true. I mean this movie is true. I will think about it many times in the future. It really has source for thinking.

# 18 October - Tuesday - Gündoğan - 18 day of immigration

I've decided to just copy my today's medium note. It's for history.

I didn’t write notes for a quite long time. I was busy and worked hard on solving my problems. Last time I published something in the beginning of summer. It’s autumn outside now.

For the last several months I was in Armenia, Russia, and Egypt. Currently I’m in Turkey. Fun fact is that it looks like I fled from mobilization. However this trip was planned before. I wanted to lose tax residency in Russia and for reaching this goal I had to spent another two months outside of the country. Currently it’s not so obvious if I can come back to Russia. Definitely I will lose tax residency there, but It’s not relevant for me anymore. I don’t want to be catched my military authorities just because I’m male.

Trying to be calm and concentrated, I’m looking to different sides and plan my future. I really want to immigrate to EU, despite the fact that they complicate the process of obtaining visas for Russian passport holders. In the worst case, I will have to consider some other countries.

Whatever it is, I don’t lose heart and try to find a solution to problem

Today I was working on bot and on article. As a result did a lot to this moment. At the same time I've got some not good news. It looks like Protugal will take statements for visa only in countries of residency. It means that I will have to ask for visa in Moscow which is irrelevant now. Also I published some new note on medium that I didn't for a very long time. I think I need to resurect this tradition and to do it more and more. It's really important. I also decided to publish all my notes on the internet. I am tired to live in fear. I need to share my thoughts with everyone. I think it's right choice. Anyway Let's see what will be the result.

# 18 October - Tuesday - Gündoğan - 19 day of immigration

Today I came back to normal condition. I meditated and did some sport. Also I came back to reactjs investigation. I think I've got everything for angular solution and now I need to switch again to that topic. It's obvious that Reactjs became a front-end standard nowadays. By the way yesterday I watched my first movie in english without subs. It was Terminator 2. You know this movie doesn't have a lot ov script lines. I think watching Tarantino movie could be much harder for me now. Newermind. I also recorded another episode of pppodcast, which is nice. Also I recorded short video in russian about place where I am. This clip is published in Telegram. Another interesting piece of news that putin proclamed military regime in annexed territories of Ukraine. It looks like schizophrenia but we live in his reality unfortunately. So. it was a couple of word about this moron, lets go back to important topics. Tomorrow I will go back to my text plans. I want to restore knock from the future rubric and translate it to English and public it in Medium. Also I need to restore my learning lessons. I will do it tomorrow as well. I understand that my condition is still unstable, but i feel much better. Another imporant thing that me and Ksusha found cheap place for luch in this area. this is a place for locals with affordable price. I think we will bacome a permanent clients of that place.

# 19 October - Tuesday - Gündoğan - 20 day of immigration

I've recorded nother video today. It was about flora of area shere I live now. After that I trained some maths. Finally I found all books athat I need for it.
