I had a very poor interview with Temedica. It's just waste of time. Today is the last day in Turkey in this trip. Today's night I am flying to Yerevan. It will be very hard to handle this night. 

I am sitting in the Terminal 1 of Antalya airport. Initially I've gone to Terminal 2 and it was a mistake. A taxi driver drove us just fo 2 eur. For unpredictable reasons ineco bank card has not worked in Airport's starbucks. I've had to pay by cash in eur.

# 02 June 2022 - Thursday - Antalya/Yerevan

I went to Yerevan. flight was very calm in spite of turbulence. We rent a hotel for 2 hours sleeping and then moved to the apartment. IT's nice. new building in appropriate place makes me happy. I also went for a walk to the city center. It's about 15 minutes from home. Well, I will be there more than for 2 months. 

Also Yesterday I started making presentation that I want to use on the interviews with companies. It will be very cool and useful. I already firure out how I will do this. There will be not only informanis about me and my career, but also couple of cases that I can shot to recruters and others.

One more thing. I feel very comfortable in Yerevan. I think the new step of my life has been started.

# 03 June 2022 - Friday - Yerevan

I've slept well. I finished a lot of deals and had a lot of conversations wth my collegs. Today the wine fenst has been started in Yerevan. Unfortunately I have restictions and cannot drink alcohol, but It still fun. Tomorrow will be weekend. I want to sleep a bit and walk. I also want to reduce my weight. Yerevan is nice place for it, becaouse there are a lot of hills and stairs. It is very good cardio. I've recieved several emails from potentional firms. One have to prepare one case, make two calls next week. So, I can resume that this Friday was good.

# 04 June 2022 - Saturday - Yerevan

I spent all day in deals. Me and Ksusha found a way how to send money to Russian and tested it. It works. It means that I can schedule the next english lesson next week. It's nice. We also bought a lot of things for home and for ourselves. At the same time we walked a lot and used taxi. The wheather in Yerevan is beautiful. Very hot air but gentle sun make good envioronment. Tomorrow We also want to make a lot. I like it, honestly.

# 05 June 2022 - Sunday - Yerevan

* 12:11 - I've finished most part of tasks for today. Nice.
* 20:56 - we had a good day. It was full of activities. One of the restaraunts was excellent. I also decided to buy Iphone 13 pro. I think it will be tomorrow. we changed all nessesary money. Drams were changed to rubles. Tomorrow I will send them to russia, to my account. It is very important. I also had a call with Oleg. i don't like his mood. i think he is very close to depression. it's sad, honestly. very very sad.

Justh thought

Many people say that programmers and people of intellectual professions in general should be out of politics. I strongly disagree with this. Only people who develop their brains and thinking during their lives can lead society to a better state. If a person claims to be intellectual, he or she should ponder and take part in politics. Otherwise society will end up with what happened in Russia.

# 06 June 2022 - Monday - Yerevan

I've bought new iphone 13 pro. I also spent time in bank in order to send money. It was sucessful. I can resurect my english lessons. Sperbank credit card has been closed. It's nice. 36-38 degree was in Yerevan. It's really hot. Honestly, the day was pretty short and I just tried to finish all my deals.

# 07 June 2022 - Tuesday - Yerevan

Also We had a good walk in the evening. Yerevan is beautiful at night. By the way I had a conflict with taxist. He didn't want to drive me by card. Only cash. i've just sent a message to customer support. They resolved everything.

Honestly, Today I don't feel good fo some reasons. I do not know why. Anyway I've made some things for my presentation, restored gypsyprog account and did some onther things. I do not want to do anything, maybe because of my condition. Hovewer we went for a walk. It was good.

# 11 June 2022 - Saturday - Yerevan

We've been walking for whole day. Top Gun: Moview was nice. The restaraunt was nice as well. I've just rest and have not done anything. This suturday has been just a free day. I like it. Maybe we will go to Sevan lake tomorrow, but we have not decided yet.

# 12 June 2022 - Sunday - Yerevan

I didn't go to Sevan today. Honestly It was not good mood. i've just gone to museum of modern art. Which is not so good and visited botanic garden, which is very good. I also a bit tiered of everything. I think you can see the waves of mood that I have. i might be mad. Sometimes I feel very bad. Exactly like in this moment. Also Yesterday The host wrote to me. I should spend 10 day somewhere in the end of this month. I tought that it sould be the next month, but not. this problem will happen in 2 weeks. It's bad because i do not have enough money and should be very careful. 

# 13 June 2022 - Monday - Yerevan

Today is a public holiday in Russia. Because of that I was free and spent time doing nothing. It's pretty nice, I would say. We walked around city center and did some deals. I like it. Today's mood is much better than yestaerdays. By the way, I souhld start prepareing for my firrst talking video for youtube. I want to write a script and tell something interesting about myself and other things. Sadly, I cannot share a lot of interesting inforation that I got from interviews that I had for the last several years. anyway I will have a chance to share this with others. Selfapy has writter to me today. They want to talk with someone of my ex-coleeges and to know something about me. Unfortuntely I need to do this. It's sad, I do not want to do it, but I have to.

# 14 June 2022 - Tuesday - Yerevan

I've had a nice call with my english teacher. it's happened, we resurected our lessons. I also did a full list of my tasks for today. It's quite good and productive. I also want to make something for Medium and Substack, becaue I still want to share my thoughts with everyone. Yea. I've also recalled that I had a call with company which is called AMBOSS or somthing like this.

By the way we finished watchinh the first season of "Succession". I really like it. It's beautiful and very rude movie. Probably today we will start whatching the second season.

# 15 June 2022 - Wednesday - Yerevan

i hav a call with Selfapy today. It was a session with a team. I was like on stand-up. Very hard I believe. other day was very smooth and without any significant news. Oh, yea, I've scheduled an appointment to LOR doctor. The iphones camera are great. i think I am ready to record a video for telegram or other media. Why not? AMBOOS rejected me. Shame on them. tomorrow I should make sport and meditation, because I've just stopped to do this. It's rally shame. And again, I again dived into depression mode. Thank you.

# 16 June 2022 - Thursday - Yerevan

I went to the hospital today and got a consultation from an ENT and a surgeon. tomorrow I need a new CT scan of my teeth. 

I also did a huge amount of tasks. today i continued my research on the topic of microfrontends. and i also did a bunch of other stuff. Also went to the train station, wanted to buy tickets for lake sevan but had to go to another station. Will do that tomorrow, and want to record a little on the mic at the same time.

# 17 June 2022 - Friday - Yerevan

They increased my salary to 35 eur per hour. It looks like that It doesn't make sence to looking for new job. It's interesting. It's first time in my life when I got this situation. It's also very significat because yesterday I sent Ivan Gammel contacts to one company that might be siutable for me. But now it looks like I can change my mind.

Oh, I also make KT today and went to railroad station to Sevan. I wanted to buy a ticket but this place doesn't have casher or something like this. I've just waste my time. Anyway it was a good walk.

So, Luckily I finished with all tasks for today. It's nice. It's good job. I am very satisfied of this day.

# 18 June 2022 - Saturday - Yerevan

So, I am still waiting an answer from Selfapy. I also had a short chat with Valery. He was a teamled in DS last year. He left company and went to startup. He told me that the start-up turned out to be a piece of shit. This day was a bit better than others. 

# 23 June 2022 - Thursday - Yerevan

I was pissed off today. I think somethings goes wrong with my nerves. I can lose temper just in the second. I consider it as bad thing. I will proceed meditation tomorrow. I need to think more about myself. Ksusha found a D7 Portugal visa, that can help us in immigration. i think she is not ready going to Amerika. Honestly Portugal one of the several Eropean countries that I like. Temedica called me. They want to postpone interview with me. It's not sad. It just doesn't bother me. Well, this night is the last one in this apartments. We need to move to another place tomorrow and go back here after one week. IO aslo tried to record pppodcast today. Honestly it's bullshit. I cannot just walking and recording my thoughts in public. I need to find another way how to note this reflections

Slavmed clinic, where a want to make operation is not so far from this place, but i will be in another place when the operation happens.

# 25 June 2022 - Saturday - Yerevan

We rented a car today. Suprisingly it was Honda Pilot, not Hunday. The policeman has sopped us and tried to get mony from me. I even went to ATM and got cash, but policeman disappiered. We aslo wen to the montain lake and to the on of the gighest montain of Armenia. There is a very intersting effect. You drive up but car drive by itself. The reason of this is optical fake. We also visited lake Sevan. I've taken a lot of pictures. unfortunately I have to return car tomorrow's morning. Yes, it is. I cannot drive on this anymore. Car is cool. really. I aslo recorded another video and send it to review. Ksusha will look at this. Wow, I've recalled Ksusha colored strand of hair to white.
