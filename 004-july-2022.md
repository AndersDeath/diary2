At the same time just after the recording I've recocred pppodcast, which is nice. By the way I've just remembered, ksusha schedule an appointment for me to visa center. Maybe if she shedules the same for her, we will ask for Finnish visa, and mught be live there for a while. Surely It depends on situation.

He is in Argentina now. His Peruan girlfried is also with him. It's nice, I think. He has a support now. She knows spanish and can solve a lot of problems. Today's morning I started doing Yoga. I've made a very simple exercises, but sweat covered my body. I've just recalled, today I wear contact lences for the first time after surgery. It is pleasure to be able to see everything correctly. So, I am not starving. I walked a lot. This day is nice. Eerything went well. Oh, one thing. I took several photos of Yerevans funicular. It's abadoned and partially ruiner. Homeless people live there. Sad story honestly.

I've visited surgeon today. Everything is ok. I need to visit him before flight to Russia. I also made some improovments for SFS project as usual. I've started implementation of avatar uploading. So, the rest of the day was quite easy. Not so cool, honestly. Today I again practiced yoga a bit. I also tried to make some kind of video about D7 visa. I am just a piece of shit. it was absolutly bad. I didn't know how to fix my phsyco problems. I was afraid of Ksusha today. This fear I felt last time many years ago when I was a student. I need practice meditation more. I do not want to feel that shit again. I will record this fucking video tomorrow. it's the only chance. It's something like a challange. The last thing for today is that I should meet Alexander Tupavov today. I was working with him for Retec many years ago. He is going to finish some deals here in Yerevan this week. Unfortunatelt his flight was deleyed because it was flyone company. The worst piece of shit on the market. I've offered him meeting on Thursday. I hope he will have time for it. Also I started listening to All-in podcast. It's about economy. Honestly it's quite interesting show. Of couse it is in English. Now I am going to sleep.

I am bored of Yerevan honestly. the heat has been trying to kill. i think I visited all palces in the city center and neighborhood. i didn't write a code today. But I was in local zoo. It is sad place. Especcially I felt sorry for the elephant. He looked as mindless. I do noi like zoos because of this. Animals should be free. Also this day is very windy. Even very very very small rain was here. I visited the barber one more time. Now my haircut is perfect. By the way I am going to pass IELTS next week. after that I will be more free that now. I am happy. Also the next 2 weeks will be last days of my living here in Yerevan. I am going back to Russia for a while and then I am going to proceed to be a gypsy.
