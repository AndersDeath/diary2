I've changed my passpord data in my PE sertificate. It's cool. I also finished a lot of english tasks. Exam is very close. When I was in ministry I faced with a problem. I had to pay a duty which was possible only by cash. I didn't have it and had to run outside to the extrimely heat streed and looking fo ATM. Fortunately, I found one not so far from the building. I cannot hide, that is was annoing situation. Anywas I did the deal. MTS and Ineco didn't anser to my phone calls. I've scheduled an appointment in Ineco for tomorrow. I will try to deal with my problems there. If I have time I will go to the MTS building as well. When I finish with that reregistration, I can leave this countrly for a while. At the same time I've still been investigating Portugal topic.

I finished with all preparation. I hope i didn't lose anything. I finidhes with simple avatar implementation. I found a very fashional solution and put pictures as avatars without uploading files system. Also I feel empty because I finished with english preparation and now I have a lot of free time. It is wierd. I need to fill this time somehow. I think I will focus on basics of Portugese and Startup book. I think I should start preparation for my future life in Portugal. It will be a challange.

# 08 August 2022 - Monday - Yerevan

I've finished with full list of my tasks. I am still in the process of my schedule changing.

# 09 August 2022 - Tuesday - Yerevan

Today I got a result of my IELTS exam. Unfortunately it's 6. It is bad. i had to spend more time on preparation. Languages knowlage is my silly side. It's rally hard for me to learn it and spend a lot of time on it. I remember how my russian language teacher told us. Ready more, guys, if you read a lot you can absorb how to sepeal and how to write. Honestly it is bullshit. It doesn't work for me. Anyway, I finished a lot of thing regarding programming today. I've started another ui for SFS project. I decided to rewrite everything in react. I think it is the only way for me to learn this library properly. I pend the half of day in efforts to create proper validation for login form. it was not so easy, I would say. but I did it. Also I finished a lot of things for DS and others. as usual though.

# 10 August 2022 - Wednesday - Yerevan

I've got the original IELTS certificate. I've confirmed B2 level of English. It's very good. I also recorded pppodcast. The day was quite, but i was extrimely anxious.

Well, I got a shower. I packed all my things. I'm ready to departure. We crossed the border well. Everything is ok. Zhukovscky airport sucks. It is very bad place. I do not want to be there again. Ksusha's mother and her husband picked up  us in that place. We ate shashlik near the roard. WE a re in Rzhev now. I will provide more tomorrow.

# 15 August 2022 - Monday - Rzhev

Today was a quite busy day. We handeled some deals that are related to daily problems like orders, PCR tests. etc. Also we were in Arabika cafe. It's quite good place in the Rzhev's city center. I like that place. It's much better that others and at the same time there is a delitious americano. We also came to Ksushas gradmother. She is old woman with cancer which is horrible. She's been fighting with in for 3 or 4 years. She has leukemia.

# 16 August 2022 - Tuesday - Rzhev

I was working for whole day. I walked a lot around. I also started reading books in Ukranian and listen to music in this language. I think it is a huge layer of the culture. It was a quite usual day. I improved SFS reactjs version a bit. Also I was woring on DS tasks. I felt not well unfortunately. It seems some kind of acclimatization.

# 17 August 2022 - Wednesday - Rzhev

I need to start write texts more thoughtfully. My spelling is worse. I want to change it. Anyway, I finished a lot of things today. As usual I am trying to be on track. Just after this diary session I want to reorganize my schedule. Today is Wednesday and I am going back to Saint-Petersburg this Saturday. I have a train from Tver. In the evering we walked on Volga's embankment. Also we had a nice talk with Ksusha's sister, mother and grandmother in the kitchen.

# 18 August 2022 - Thursday - Rzhev

We had a conversation my colleegs about German business visa. Probably it might be a good thing as an emergancy exit from Russia. Also I feel bad because of acclimatization or I just got sick for some reasons. TOday I fell a bit better, but anyway it is not good. Ksusha is out for whole day. It's sad. Anyway despite on those facts, I finished a full list of my business. And I am going to cook =) I need to make some food for myself because I do not have money for visiting a cafe. 

# 19 August 2022 - Friday - Rzhev

Actually this day is also good. I feel not so well. A small feaver makes me sad. At the same time i look around and think that I am happy and have everything for the future normal life. Despite the fact that The was has been started 6 months ago, I do not feel bad anymore. Surely It is not the same sutiation like it was before the war, but better that nothing. I learned protuguese a bit today. Maybe I will know more shortly. Let's see. Now I am in the Ksusha's grandmother house. It's nice very soviet place. I need only finish with post for TG and with presentation task.

# 20 August 2022 - Saturday - Rzhev - Tver - Saint-Petersburg

We are going home today. We are sitting in a cafe in Tver. Ksushas mother and her husband drove us to Tver. The mother had an appointment in medical center. Then we separated and went to different sides. Me and Ksusha walked around Tvers city-center and then went to cafe that I mentioned before. We spet a lot of time there and them met again Ksushas mother and mother's husband. They invited us to Georgian restaraunt that was quite good. After that we went to huge mall GLobus that is in depressibve Tver's district. we walked there, got a cup of tea and bought some goods in train. After that they drove us to the central railway station. We sat to the train and now I am writing this lines there. Also I decied to restructure this diary. for the first time i downloaded it to the laptop and separated big file to smaller ones.

# 21 August 2022 - Sunday - Saint-Petersburg

I met Artyom Sagaida today. He is a front-end chapter lead in drsmile and back then he was my teamlead. He is a very professianal. We talked a bit about us and about job. honestly It was somthing like real getting to know. We were in British backery which is on Mayakovskaya metro station in the Saint-Petersburg city center. i am glad to see him. I hope we will meet each other in reallity in the future. Anywas I also sorted out the suitcases after our trip. Me and Ksusha met each other in the sity center and were in Beirut cafe which is nice place but unfortunately very expencieve. They changed prices because of war. It is sad, but ok. We walked a bit aroud and have a  nice time honestly. I would be happy to repeat this expierence again. 

I didn't write about politics for a very long time. Now I have to. So, here in russia we have a facist philosopher Dugin. His daoguhter was blown up in the car today. Someone wanted to kill him but made a mistake. I consider it as a terror. I am afraid of this tendency. it is hard to think that Russia became not a terror but just dangarous from existence perspective country.

in the evening we went to Auchan and bought some goods. We have to save money now, because we just do not have them. Anyway we cooked a dinner today. I think it was a firts time for a very long period when we made a dishes. It's fun. Also I need to make something with insurance for car. I will handle it tomorrow, maybe. I need to contact with an angend and she will make all that she need to.

That probably it for today. It's cool to write a text when you are in a good mood. i feel that I am at home. I can write and text anything, but from phisical perspective this place is my home. I have a problem with it, unfortunately i have to leave this place. there is the only person who destroyed everything. I wil remember it forever. I think not only me. Today's exploition somewhere in Moscow region ar effects of that evil which they rised up.

I've just recalled that I need to add one thing. Max Cavalera book is cool. It's very easy to read. But this book won't improve my skills. It's just for fun.

# 22 August 2022 - Monday - Saint-Petersburg

This day was a full of business. I bought an insurance for the car. Also I finished a lot of planned tasks including creating of the new category in my TG channel. It's knock from the future. i want to publish news about cool new technologies that we do not have here. I think it will be fun. I've got the car in the evening. Fortunately it works and in good condition. I need olnly check anifreeze tomorrow. grandmother and Vladimir Alexandrovich are in good mood and do a lot of things. I am happy that they have energy for all business they want to do. I've drove around neigbourhood. It was nice. Unfortunately Lada is not so good car and feel tiered. And the weather is very typicall for this area. It's rainy and very wet outside. today is my brother birthday.

# 23 August 2022 - Tuesday - Saint-Petersburg

I tought a lot about my life today. Honestly being here in Sain-Petersburg is extrimely depressive thing for me. I had a good mood in the first day after coming back, but now I am not in good condition. I really fell like I am in the flood here. It's extrimely annoing feeling. I want to see changes, I want to feel myself as free. I do not feel this way here. 

Newermind I prepared list of things that I want to sell on Avito. Tomorrow I will take theirs photos and publish in on the internet. I want to rise some money. In better case I will have arout 50k rubles. It will be very helpful for us in our situation.

I fell better from physical perspective, but Ksusha got sick and has fever. It's sad. I do not like to see her in this condition. She eats pills and does everything for being healthy.

The landlord came for the money and fixed some kitchen stuff. It's nice. Thanks to him.

# 24 August 2022 - Wednesday - Saint-Petersburg

Ive started this day from product training and english learning. I also fixed tooth. Prices for dental service increased a lot. it's not a surprise. Also I published knock from the future piece of news. I think it will be fun to publish this kind of stuff. I've started taken photos of goods that I want to sell on Avito. Patially i finished with it. I need a bit more time for it. Honestly I am very tiered again =) As usual i am complaning about it. by the way, I started investigation of the next brand new font-end topic. it simple terms i want to mage simple angular application with firebase auth inegration but on very deep level. there will be registration, changing password think etc. i want to use this stuff as parts of MVP solutions in the future. But sfS project is still my highest priority. after dinner we are going to the city center.

# 25 August 2022 - Thursday - Saint-Perersburg

Today I mostly was working on DRSMILE release. I spent a bit time on setting up Apple developer and distribution certificates. This is quite shitty process. Also I had a nice call with Artem, who is my coleege. In the evening i and Ksusha are going to walk in the city center. I think i will be nice. We are going to Obvodniy channel. After that I do not know what we will do. I also proceeded working on small angular+firebase+auth thing. I want to finish with it tomorrow and after that create a new project within DRSMILE. That is probably it for today.

# 26 August 2022 - Friday - Saint-Petersburg

I was working on issues and tasks for whole day. Mostly I was focused on Angular + firebase + auth investigation. It works. I need only to fix some visualization and separate everything to steps. The plan is to use in as a basis for future article. I think I will write in in English. I do not want to use Russian language for it anymore. I am sure that it is waste of time. I need to collect information for the book. Programming is not only coding, but it is also some kind of philosophy. This idea is very exiting. Ksusha met Sasha, which is her friend from univercity. they are pretty close. Oh, I've forgottent to mention that today I has a call with potentional reactjs candidate. It's cool. This interview was just disaster and that guy doesn't know enough for working in DRSMILE.

# 27 August 2022 - Saturday - Saint-Petersburg

Pppodcast was recorded today. We went to raketa manufacture today. There is museum we wanted to visit, but it was closed. It's really sad. Also we visited Vkusno i tochka again. Ksusha is still ill. I am afraid of this. I think she should sit at home, but it's quite impossible. She wants to be everywhere, which is not smart. I sould be stonger and protect her. Also I've lost Kazakhsat sim card. That morons sold it to someone. It means that i cannot restore access to kaspi bank and Halyk is also in danger. I have money on the last one. I should spend it as soon as possible. Kazakhstan is aweful place. I hate it. I do not remember shuch unfriendly country. maybe only sayshelles islands were the same. I think I should forget about 150 dollars that I have on halyk account. As I mentioned I will try to spend them outside of Russia, but if it will be impossible i also won't be sad. Shitty country.

# 27 August - Sunday - Saint-Petersburg

Today I had a rest. I spent whole day doing nothing. We went to the city center and drunk a limonade in one of the beautiful places. I do not remeber the name of this place and i am not sure that i want to come back there. at the same time I eat a lot today. it is not so good. I nwed to be in concentration and do not get a lot of waste calories. My mood is not so good.
