I had to pay a duty which was possible only by cash. I didn't have it and had to run outside to the extrimely heat streed and looking fo ATM. Fortunately, I found one not so far from the building. I cannot hide, that is was annoing situation. Anywas I did the deal. MTS and Ineco didn't anser to my phone calls. I've scheduled an appointment in Ineco for tomorrow. I will try to deal with my problems there. If I have time I will go to the MTS building as well. When I finish with that reregistration, I can leave this countrly for a while. At the same time I've still been investigating Portugal topic.

Today I got a result of my IELTS exam. Unfortunately it's 6. It is bad. i had to spend more time on preparation. Languages knowlage is my silly side. It's rally hard for me to learn it and spend a lot of time on it. I remember how my russian language teacher told us. Ready more, guys, if you read a lot you can absorb how to sepeal and how to write. Honestly it is bullshit. It doesn't work for me. Anyway, I finished a lot of thing regarding programming today. I've started another ui for SFS project. I decided to rewrite everything in react. I think it is the only way for me to learn this library properly. I pend the half of day in efforts to create proper validation for login form. it was not so easy, I would say. but I did it. Also I finished a lot of things for DS and others. as usual though.

# 18 August 2022 - Thursday - Rzhev

We had a conversation my colleegs about German business visa. Probably it might be a good thing as an emergancy exit from Russia. Also I feel bad because of acclimatization or I just got sick for some reasons. TOday I fell a bit better, but anyway it is not good. Ksusha is out for whole day. It's sad. Anyway despite on those facts, I finished a full list of my business. And I am going to cook =) I need to make some food for myself because I do not have money for visiting a cafe. 

# 19 August 2022 - Friday - Rzhev

Actually this day is also good. I feel not so well. A small feaver makes me sad. At the same time i look around and think that I am happy and have everything for the future normal life. Despite the fact that The was has been started 6 months ago, I do not feel bad anymore. Surely It is not the same sutiation like it was before the war, but better that nothing. I learned protuguese a bit today. Maybe I will know more shortly. Let's see. Now I am in the Ksusha's grandmother house. It's nice very soviet place. I need only finish with post for TG and with presentation task.

Then we separated and went to different sides. Me and Ksusha walked around Tvers city-center and then went to cafe that I mentioned before. We spet a lot of time there and them met again Ksushas mother and mother's husband. They invited us to Georgian restaraunt that was quite good. After that we went to huge mall GLobus that is in depressibve Tver's district. we walked there, got a cup of tea and bought some goods in train. After that they drove us to the central railway station. We sat to the train and now I am writing this lines there. Also I decied to restructure this diary. for the first time i downloaded it to the laptop and separated big file to smaller ones.

# 21 August 2022 - Sunday - Saint-Petersburg

I met Artyom Sagaida today. He is a front-end chapter lead in drsmile and back then he was my teamlead. He is a very professianal. We talked a bit about us and about job. honestly It was somthing like real getting to know. We were in British backery which is on Mayakovskaya metro station in the Saint-Petersburg city center. i am glad to see him. I hope we will meet each other in reallity in the future. Anywas I also sorted out the suitcases after our trip. Me and Ksusha met each other in the sity center and were in Beirut cafe which is nice place but unfortunately very expencieve. They changed prices because of war. It is sad, but ok. We walked a bit aroud and have a  nice time honestly. I would be happy to repeat this expierence again. 

I didn't write about politics for a very long time. Now I have to. So, here in russia we have a facist philosopher Dugin. His daoguhter was blown up in the car today. Someone wanted to kill him but made a mistake. I consider it as a terror. I am afraid of this tendency. it is hard to think that Russia became not a terror but just dangarous from existence perspective country.

in the evening we went to Auchan and bought some goods. We have to save money now, because we just do not have them. Anyway we cooked a dinner today. I think it was a firts time for a very long period when we made a dishes. It's fun.
