I need practice meditation more. I do not want to feel that shit again. I will record this fucking video tomorrow. it's the only chance. It's something like a challange. The last thing for today is that I should meet Alexander Tupavov today. I was working with him for Retec many years ago. He is going to finish some deals here in Yerevan this week. Unfortunatelt his flight was deleyed because it was flyone company. The worst piece of shit on the market. I've offered him meeting on Thursday. I hope he will have time for it.

I cannot hide, that is was annoing situation. Anywas I did the deal. MTS and Ineco didn't anser to my phone calls. I've scheduled an appointment in Ineco for tomorrow. I will try to deal with my problems there. If I have time I will go to the MTS building as well. When I finish with that reregistration, I can leave this countrly for a while. At the same time I've still been investigating Portugal topic.

Today I got a result of my IELTS exam. Unfortunately it's 6. It is bad. i had to spend more time on preparation. Languages knowlage is my silly side. It's rally hard for me to learn it and spend a lot of time on it. I remember how my russian language teacher told us. Ready more, guys, if you read a lot you can absorb how to sepeal and how to write. Honestly it is bullshit. It doesn't work for me. Anyway, I finished a lot of thing regarding programming today. I've started another ui for SFS project. I decided to rewrite everything in react. I think it is the only way for me to learn this library properly. I pend the half of day in efforts to create proper validation for login form. it was not so easy, I would say. but I did it. Also I finished a lot of things for DS and others. as usual though.

# 15 August 2022 - Monday - Rzhev

Today was a quite busy day. We handeled some deals that are related to daily problems like orders, PCR tests. etc. Also we were in Arabika cafe. It's quite good place in the Rzhev's city center. I like that place. It's much better that others and at the same time there is a delitious americano. We also came to Ksushas gradmother. She is old woman with cancer which is horrible. She's been fighting with in for 3 or 4 years. She has leukemia.

# 16 August 2022 - Tuesday - Rzhev

I improved SFS reactjs version a bit. Also I was woring on DS tasks. I felt not well unfortunately. It seems some kind of acclimatization.

# 17 August 2022 - Wednesday - Rzhev

Just after this diary session I want to reorganize my schedule. Today is Wednesday and I am going back to Saint-Petersburg this Saturday. I have a train from Tver. In the evering we walked on Volga's embankment. Also we had a nice talk with Ksusha's sister, mother and grandmother in the kitchen.

# 18 August 2022 - Thursday - Rzhev

We had a conversation my colleegs about German business visa. Probably it might be a good thing as an emergancy exit from Russia. Also I feel bad because of acclimatization or I just got sick for some reasons. TOday I fell a bit better, but anyway it is not good. Ksusha is out for whole day. It's sad. Anyway despite on those facts, I finished a full list of my business. And I am going to cook =) I need to make some food for myself because I do not have money for visiting a cafe. 

# 19 August 2022 - Friday - Rzhev

Actually this day is also good. I feel not so well. A small feaver makes me sad. At the same time i look around and think that I am happy and have everything for the future normal life. Despite the fact that The was has been started 6 months ago, I do not feel bad anymore. Surely It is not the same sutiation like it was before the war, but better that nothing. I learned protuguese a bit today. Maybe I will know more shortly. Let's see. Now I am in the Ksusha's grandmother house. It's nice very soviet place. I need only finish with post for TG and with presentation task.

# 20 August 2022 - Saturday - Rzhev - Tver

We are going home today. We are sitting in a cafe in Tver. Ksushas mother and her husband drove us to Tver. The mother had an appointment in medical center. Then we separated and went to different sides. Me and Ksusha walked around Tvers city-center and then went to cafe that I mentioned before.
