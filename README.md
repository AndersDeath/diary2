Hello everybody! My name is Vladimir Bolshakov and this is my first note in the git diary. I've decided to start these notes in order to improve my English skills and avoid my native russian language usage. Maybe some of these words and sentencies will become as articles on Medium platform or somewhere else. During writing the first version of each text I will not use spelling systems for a grammar checking. 

More than for one month, Russian have been at war with Ukraine. It's extrimely sad, but Russia is an evil. I cannot live with it. I do not want to a part of this evil. But I am. I was born in this damn country.

# 04 April 2022

Today I am depressed a lot. I hate this war. I cannot accept this. Putin should be fired. He should be prisoned. He should be sued. A dictator is a realt traitor of Russia.

# 05 April 2022

Today I've visited tax office. This is the first step of immigration preparation. I hope everything will be ok. Meditation works.

# 06 April 2022

I published note about SSJ-100. I've been waiting money from Drsmile. There are problems again there. I hate it and it's probably happened due to sactions. I really want immigrate asap. I also will talk with CEO today. It's good. After work I will go to the barber.

# 07 Arlil 2022

Today was a full day of meeting. Car battery is dead, and I didn't understand why, I've put the accumulator to my kitchen and plug it to charger. So, I hope I can use car today's evening.

# 08 April 2022

Today I've got just a day off. I didn't do anything. Me and Ksenia came to the coast for the Gulf of Finland. It was rare sunny day. 

# 09 April 2022

It's very interesting time. I am trying not to be insane. It's really hard to think about future. Today I've made my usual diary record. It was the second one made on ipad. Unfortunately I cannot connect a microphone to a phone due to problems with usb-c connector. But ipad works. By the way, I am writing it using web version of GitHub. Maybe in the future I will start writing notes with more details. I do not know. Now It's just an improvisation. Thanks.

# 10 April 2022

Since this day I use only english for publication. I also feel bad. tomorrow I write more

# 12 April 2022

Tomorrow I didn't have power for writing my ideas. Today Is the same. Only think that i can fix - I've visited MVD today in order to update my foreign passport. I've just got a ticket for tomorrrow. I will got there again. I also had a unseccussful call with one interesting company today. so, I am a bit depressive. I hate all that bullshit that is releated to my country. It is really hard to live in this atmosphere. but anyway I got money to my armenian account. It's really cool. But it is maybe first time when monet doesn't make me happy.

# 13 April 2022

Today I visited that athoryties and it was just waste of time. I am going to visit them tomorrow again, and Maybe I will achive something. I also have got an interesting offer from DrSmile. They just offered me stocks. It's very interesting. My mood is still not good. I am trying to fix it. I also had a couple of interviews with companies. The first one was quite interesting, but unfortunately they doesn't offer fully remote job. Other company was just waste of time. Very poor idea.

# 14 April 2022

I've already handed over fingerprints and retina. I hope my new passport will be ready soon. I also got email from Chis. He is SEO of DrSmile. They just offered me option. i will be aroud 40000 euros. Good sum, I think. In fact I have to sleep with it. 

# 15 April 2022

Today is saturday which is nice. I've got new Riffisen bank card, that is needable for sending money from Armenia to Russia. Unfortunately inbuilt insurance quite bad, I think I have to be without it. Anyway I need the bank account. Afternoon I met my protesist. He's made cast of teeth hopefully I wil be with new tooth next week. I also going to Rzhev in two weeks. I like this place very much. 

# 16 April 2022

I've recorded another one audio diary file today. I had a great trip on my car. It was good thing. The bad thing is that airbnb blocked me on site. I can see everything, but I cannot rent an apartment. It's sad, and I cannot fix it by myself. I've just texted to customer support, hopefully the will fix it. At the same time tommorow my vacation is going to start officially.

# 17 April 2022

I've done a lot of suff today. I almost finished with my english hometask which is great. I also closed my accounts in Tinkoff. I've looked for tires. i also staretd using todoist that is an amaizing service for todo lists. Now I am just tyried. Anyway Today I have not only good things, but also inconviniens ones. I cannot use Airbnb anymore because of my citizenship. I think they are nazists and even if their system was designed this way. I mean strong releation to citizenship. they could figure out something in order to help russians and belarussian who want to leave countries. But it is not so important for the Airbnb corporation. I know tha they can, because I am a programmer and I am vey good in this topic. anyway, god will be a jude for them.

I really think a lot about Canada. I believe it will be a better place for immigration. I do not want to live in russia anymore. I dissapointed.

# 18 April 2022

Today I've finished several deals. I've got new Reiffeisen MIR card. I also had interesting interviews with 2 companies. One of them was Colibri company, other was InsideOut. It was nice. I also visited KT and made 3d picture of my jaws. 

Ineco bank did not want to make a payment for 5,000 euros. I had to call them and explain that I was not using them as a transit bank and I was going to live in Armenia. 

I'll probably get a new tooth tomorrow. Also, I counted my bills, after I convert the money into rubles, I will pay them.

# 08 May 2022

The doctor found a reason why I suffer from nose deseases. I am a victim of aspirin triada. It means that I am in dengerous place with my nose and breathe system.

By the way, I am in good for the last 2 days. It worries me. It's like I'm bipolar. However the most real reason is that I've got money and I've just finished get nervous.

I will reshape it, because I always forget something during the day and cannot remember it in the evening.

# 21 May 2022 - Saturday - Saint-Petersburg

I restructured artciels repo, because it is not only about articles anymore. Tomorrow I'm going to create separate repo for diary. This articles repo will be archived, but not deleted. All content except diary will merged with obsidian repo. I want to gather everything that might be published in one place. By the way i visited Primors today. It's nice city not so far from Viborg. Of course it's the gulf of Finland. I love that place. also I eat a burger wich is not so good. Tomorrow I am goint to meet my aunt and mom. I didn't see them for the very long time. I also think that it is the last note on this repo.
UPDATE: I've changed my mind. It might be not a right design. Maybe I should merge articles and typescript repos. I should think about it. The situation is that I collect inforation in different repos, but all of these are about the same and not structured. It should be fixed. at the same time I should separate diary from the articles.

# 22 May 2022 - Sunday - Saint-Petersburg

I didn't have time to deal with diary today. I was extrimely busy. I've seen mother and aunt today. It was very nice. Church is still the same like 20 years ago. Musik the cat is beautiful.

# 26 May 2022 - Thursday - Saint-Peterburg/Moscow

Yesterday I worked a lot on preparing for trip to Turkey and Armenia. I've made a list with things I need to get with me. It's very useful, I would say. In addition, there was not very good news. Strapi just cancelled the call. It was very rude because I spent time on preparations. Hovewer I had doubts about them. Stapi's handbook is just a piece of trash. Anyway I was disapoited and happy at the same time. I had a free evening and time for preparation for the trip. I am writing it in the morning. It's about 9.43am now. I will try to add some thoughts here in the end of the day. I wish good trip for myself.
I'm in the hotel at Domodedovo. Sapsan was good. But, I spent 2 hours in taxi. Moscow has huge traffic. I do not like this city. Anyway Tomorrow i will be in Turkey.

# 27 May 2022 - Friday - Moscow/Antalia/Kaş

It will be interesting because It will be the first a presentation in English for me. Nice. 

# 31 May 2022 - Tuesday - Kaş/Patara

Today's evening I've spent on Patara beach. It's super beautiful place. The incredible sunset has just broken my mind. It's amazing. We also find nice place which is called Butka.

I really will be happy to work with them. At the same time. Today is the last spring day. Summer is very close to us.

Nastya brought documents to my grandmother and sent letter to the tax office. Big thanks to her.

The very bad meeting was on DrSmile. Thay want to introduce chaika-management. I do not like it at all. I should spend more time on interview preparations.

# 01 June 2022 - Wednesday - Kaş

I had a very poor interview with Temedica. It's just waste of time. Today is the last day in Turkey in this trip. Today's night I am flying to Yerevan. It will be very hard to handle this night. 

I am sitting in the Terminal 1 of Antalya airport. Initially I've gone to Terminal 2 and it was a mistake. A taxi driver drove us just fo 2 eur. For unpredictable reasons ineco bank card has not worked in Airport's starbucks. I've had to pay by cash in eur.

# 02 June 2022 - Thursday - Antalya/Yerevan

I went to Yerevan. flight was very calm in spite of turbulence. We rent a hotel for 2 hours sleeping and then moved to the apartment. IT's nice. new building in appropriate place makes me happy. I also went for a walk to the city center. It's about 15 minutes from home. Well, I will be there more than for 2 months. 

Also Yesterday I started making presentation that I want to use on the interviews with companies. It will be very cool and useful. I already firure out how I will do this. There will be not only informanis about me and my career, but also couple of cases that I can shot to recruters and others.

One more thing. I feel very comfortable in Yerevan. I think the new step of my life has been started.

# 03 June 2022 - Friday - Yerevan

I've slept well. I finished a lot of deals and had a lot of conversations wth my collegs. Today the wine fenst has been started in Yerevan. Unfortunately I have restictions and cannot drink alcohol, but It still fun. Tomorrow will be weekend. I want to sleep a bit and walk. I also want to reduce my weight. Yerevan is nice place for it, becaouse there are a lot of hills and stairs. It is very good cardio. I've recieved several emails from potentional firms. One have to prepare one case, make two calls next week. So, I can resume that this Friday was good.

# 04 June 2022 - Saturday - Yerevan

I spent all day in deals. Me and Ksusha found a way how to send money to Russian and tested it. It works. It means that I can schedule the next english lesson next week. It's nice.

Tomorrow We also want to make a lot. I like it, honestly.

# 05 June 2022 - Sunday - Yerevan

* 12:11 - I've finished most part of tasks for today. Nice.

Drams were changed to rubles. Tomorrow I will send them to russia, to my account. It is very important. I also had a call with Oleg. i don't like his mood. i think he is very close to depression. it's sad, honestly. very very sad.

Justh thought

Many people say that programmers and people of intellectual professions in general should be out of politics. I strongly disagree with this. Only people who develop their brains and thinking during their lives can lead society to a better state. If a person claims to be intellectual, he or she should ponder and take part in politics. Otherwise society will end up with what happened in Russia.

# 06 June 2022 - Monday - Yerevan

I've bought new iphone 13 pro. I also spent time in bank in order to send money. It was sucessful. I can resurect my english lessons. Sperbank credit card has been closed. It's nice. 36-38 degree was in Yerevan. It's really hot. Honestly, the day was pretty short and I just tried to finish all my deals.

# 07 June 2022 - Tuesday - Yerevan

I've bought case and glass for ipohne. It's ready for video creation. Tomorrow I will try to do this. I also sent the final bunch of money to Russsia. I've got my it sertificate from accountant. Also We had a good walk in the evening. Yerevan is beautiful at night. By the way I had a conflict with taxist. He didn't want to drive me by card. Only cash. i've just sent a message to customer support. They resolved everything.

# 08 June 2022 - Wednesday - Yerevan

Well I had a huge list of tasks for today. 26 of them in my todolist. I happy that I finished all of them. I continued working on temedica presentation, management degree and other important things. I finished a lot of features for DS. So, Now I am just sitting here and trying not to became mad. I am extrimely tired. I also tried jumper today. it's nice and very hard for me. also I selected clinics that I want to try for my nose problems. Maybe I will make that surgery in Yerevan. I also provided good feedback about Anatolii the QA. He is well. 

I also want to resurect my project that I did before the war. I will create a plan and oly after that proceed programming. Nevermind, I am wating for dinner now. After I will walk.

I mean recording videos. Now I can do this, because I have all kind of equipment for it. And now I am going sleep. I think I will sleep well.


# 10 June 2022 - Friday - Yerevan

Honestly, Today I don't feel good fo some reasons. I do not know why. Anyway I've made some things for my presentation, restored gypsyprog account and did some onther things. I do not want to do anything, maybe because of my condition. Hovewer we went for a walk. It was good.

# 11 June 2022 - Saturday - Yerevan

We've been walking for whole day. Top Gun: Moview was nice. The restaraunt was nice as well. I've just rest and have not done anything. This suturday has been just a free day. I like it. Maybe we will go to Sevan lake tomorrow, but we have not decided yet.

# 12 June 2022 - Sunday - Yerevan

I didn't go to Sevan today. Honestly It was not good mood. i've just gone to museum of modern art. Which is not so good and visited botanic garden, which is very good. I also a bit tiered of everything. I think you can see the waves of mood that I have. i might be mad. Sometimes I feel very bad. Exactly like in this moment. Also Yesterday The host wrote to me. I should spend 10 day somewhere in the end of this month. I tought that it sould be the next month, but not. this problem will happen in 2 weeks. It's bad because i do not have enough money and should be very careful.

Today is a public holiday in Russia. Because of that I was free and spent time doing nothing. It's pretty nice, I would say. We walked around city center and did some deals. I like it. Today's mood is much better than yestaerdays. By the way, I souhld start prepareing for my firrst talking video for youtube. I want to write a script and tell something interesting about myself and other things. Sadly, I cannot share a lot of interesting inforation that I got from interviews that I had for the last several years. anyway I will have a chance to share this with others. Selfapy has writter to me today. They want to talk with someone of my ex-coleeges and to know something about me. Unfortuntely I need to do this. It's sad, I do not want to do it, but I have to.

# 14 June 2022 - Tuesday - Yerevan

I've had a nice call with my english teacher. it's happened, we resurected our lessons. I also did a full list of my tasks for today. It's quite good and productive. I also want to make something for Medium and Substack, becaue I still want to share my thoughts with everyone. Yea. I've also recalled that I had a call with company which is called AMBOSS or somthing like this.

By the way we finished watchinh the first season of "Succession". I really like it. It's beautiful and very rude movie. Probably today we will start whatching the second season.

# 15 June 2022 - Wednesday - Yerevan

i hav a call with Selfapy today. It was a session with a team. I was like on stand-up. Very hard I believe. other day was very smooth and without any significant news. Oh, yea, I've scheduled an appointment to LOR doctor. The iphones camera are great. i think I am ready to record a video for telegram or other media. Why not? AMBOOS rejected me. Shame on them. tomorrow I should make sport and meditation, because I've just stopped to do this. It's rally shame. And again, I again dived into depression mode. Thank you.

# 16 June 2022 - Thursday - Yerevan

I went to the hospital today and got a consultation from an ENT and a surgeon. tomorrow I need a new CT scan of my teeth. 

I also did a huge amount of tasks. today i continued my research on the topic of microfrontends. and i also did a bunch of other stuff. Also went to the train station, wanted to buy tickets for lake sevan but had to go to another station. Will do that tomorrow, and want to record a little on the mic at the same time.

# 17 June 2022 - Friday - Yerevan

They increased my salary to 35 eur per hour. It looks like that It doesn't make sence to looking for new job. It's interesting. It's first time in my life when I got this situation. It's also very significat because yesterday I sent Ivan Gammel contacts to one company that might be siutable for me. But now it looks like I can change my mind.

Oh, I also make KT today and went to railroad station to Sevan. I wanted to buy a ticket but this place doesn't have casher or something like this. I've just waste my time. Anyway it was a good walk.

So, Luckily I finished with all tasks for today. It's nice. It's good job. I am very satisfied of this day.

# 18 June 2022 - Saturday - Yerevan

We are goint to Sevan lake. Defenetly it will be bus drive.

We didn't go to Sevan again. We found a very cheap Chinice restaraunt and ate a lot of food. Becouse of that I've became heavy and lazy. I also bought a learnin book for Armanian language, tomorrow I will try to study something. 

Also I did nothing today. It's great. Tomorrom I will go local barber. It will be my first try to cut hair not in Ivans chair.

So, I am still waiting an answer from Selfapy. I also had a short chat with Valery. He was a teamled in DS last year. He left company and went to startup. He told me that the start-up turned out to be a piece of shit. This day was a bit better than others. 

# 23 June 2022 - Thursday - Yerevan

I was pissed off today. I think somethings goes wrong with my nerves. I can lose temper just in the second. I consider it as bad thing. I will proceed meditation tomorrow. I need to think more about myself. Ksusha found a D7 Portugal visa, that can help us in immigration. i think she is not ready going to Amerika. Honestly Portugal one of the several Eropean countries that I like. Temedica called me. They want to postpone interview with me. It's not sad. It just doesn't bother me. Well, this night is the last one in this apartments. We need to move to another place tomorrow and go back here after one week. IO aslo tried to record pppodcast today. Honestly it's bullshit.

We aslo wen to the montain lake and to the on of the gighest montain of Armenia. There is a very intersting effect. You drive up but car drive by itself. The reason of this is optical fake. We also visited lake Sevan. I've taken a lot of pictures. unfortunately I have to return car tomorrow's morning. Yes, it is. I cannot drive on this anymore. Car is cool. really. I aslo recorded another video and send it to review. Ksusha will look at this. Wow, I've recalled Ksusha colored strand of hair to white.
