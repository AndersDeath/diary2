By the way, I am in good for the last 2 days. It worries me. It's like I'm bipolar. However the most real reason is that I've got money and I've just finished get nervous. In a way, I just accepted the new reality and went into fight mode.

I am very tired today. It's been a full day of meetings. By the way, Drsmile has bought PlusDental company. CEO are waiting for an approve by German govenment,. I also had a meeting with one German company. We discussed me. flight tickets were bought. We are going to Turkey firstly and then we are going to Armenia. It will be interesting. Mom has been waiting for me. i will to her on sunday. At the same time, I don't like this approach that I use in thing diary. I will reshape it, because I always forget something during the day and cannot remember it in the evening.

# 21 May 2022 - Saturday - Saint-Petersburg

I restructured artciels repo, because it is not only about articles anymore. Tomorrow I'm going to create separate repo for diary. This articles repo will be archived, but not deleted. All content except diary will merged with obsidian repo. I want to gather everything that might be published in one place. By the way i visited Primors today. It's nice city not so far from Viborg. Of course it's the gulf of Finland. I love that place. also I eat a burger wich is not so good. Tomorrow I am goint to meet my aunt and mom. I didn't see them for the very long time. I also think that it is the last note on this repo.
UPDATE: I've changed my mind. It might be not a right design. Maybe I should merge articles and typescript repos. I should think about it. The situation is that I collect inforation in different repos, but all of these are about the same and not structured. It should be fixed. at the same time I should separate diary from the articles.

# 22 May 2022 - Sunday - Saint-Petersburg

I didn't have time to deal with diary today. I was extrimely busy. I've seen mother and aunt today. It was very nice. Church is still the same like 20 years ago. Musik the cat is beautiful. It's a very nice and friendly animal. I helped mother with shopping. I also recorded might be the last pppdocast from the car for the next several month. I should invent another format for that records. By the way I am very tiered. Ath the same time I've stopped writing code. I don not have time for it. It's very bad and sad. I want to be more involved into programming. I am not ready cut myself from coding yet.

# 23 May 2022 - Monday - Saint-Petersburg

I've got new driver licence. It's nice. I finished all documents preparation. I also have done with english texts. All that i need is sleep. I also thought a lot about opning a business in Yerevan. It might be outsource company. Why not? I think it's nice take. Tomorrow I will have time to fix all these deals that I planned. I just didn't have time. At the next weekend I will in Turkey. And I need to fix spelling here. I will be nice, I think.

By the way. it's the last note here. i will copy full diary to other repo soon.

# 25 May 2022 - Wednesday - Saint-Peterburg

Honestly, I feel like I am a slave in DrSmile. I cannot change job quick. I do not have visa and other documents. It's frustrating.

# 26 May 2022 - Thursday - Saint-Peterburg/Moscow

Yesterday I worked a lot on preparing for trip to Turkey and Armenia. I've made a list with things I need to get with me. It's very useful, I would say. In addition, there was not very good news. Strapi just cancelled the call. It was very rude because I spent time on preparations. Hovewer I had doubts about them. Stapi's handbook is just a piece of trash. Anyway I was disapoited and happy at the same time. I had a free evening and time for preparation for the trip. I am writing it in the morning. It's about 9.43am now. I will try to add some thoughts here in the end of the day. I wish good trip for myself.
I'm in the hotel at Domodedovo. Sapsan was good. But, I spent 2 hours in taxi. Moscow has huge traffic. I do not like this city. Anyway Tomorrow i will be in Turkey.

# 27 May 2022 - Friday - Moscow/Antalia/Kaş

I've passed immigration control. So, I am here in Kash. It was a long flight, maybe about 5 hours. I woke up at 5 am. Take off was at 9 am. In Antalia we were at 15 pm and then about 3 hours by car. There are no supermarkets and cafes nearby. It's sad, but not critical. The car is Citroen, it's very cheap one. So, i left Russian till the next August.
